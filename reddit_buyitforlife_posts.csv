"I'd just like to encourage everyone never to buy a TomTom GPS. They've classified my 2-year-old unit as ""obsolete"" and will no longer provide ""lifetime updates"" on it. Their solution? Buy a new GPS from them with ""lifetime updates!"" I've called and emailed customer service six times, to no avail.","What model do you have?

TomTom GPS devices have a pretty shitty lockout and are extremely easy to hack/pirate maps for. My Dad refuses to buy a new GPS and still uses a TomTom XL IQ Routers Edition model. This model has hit end-of-life and cannot be updated officially, but I just put the latest maps on it (from aprox. December 6, 2018).

Everything you need to know is here: www.gpsurl.com

1. Plug in your GPS to your computer, ignore any autoplay stuff from Windows or TomTom software. Take a full backup of the device (manually copy/paste the entire contents of drive).

2. Download [FastActivate](https://www.gpsurl.com/tomtom-open-tools-and-tweaks/183754-fastactivate-post-1-includes-updater.html). Copy the executable to the root of your device and run it. Select ""My Device Info"" (I think option 7) and wait for Notepad to pop open. There will be a line that says software or navcore version, it will be four numerical digits (most likely 9xxx). This is your navcore version. Also take note what map(s) are listed. Close FastActivate.

3. Check to see what map(s) are compatible with your device/navcore combination [here](https://www.gpsurl.com/tomtom-maps/244778-compatible-chart-v1020-maps.html). If your navcore is extremely outdated, proceed to step 4, if your navcore will support the latest maps, proceed to step 5.

4. THIS IS ONLY NECESSARY IF YOUR NAVCORE IS TOO OLD TO SUPPORT NEWER MAPS: Install/Update the official software from TomTom (TomTom Home 2) and fully update the internal software (navcore) of the device. TT Home will bitch about the device being EoL but it will still let you update the system software and update QuickGPSFix (although pointless, you'll see).

5. Download the map(s) you want from [here](https://www.gpsurl.com/tomtom-maps-with-meta-codes/). Make sure you get a version that's compatible with your device/navcore combo (as checked in step 3. Maps are labeled as LOCATION_XXXX_YYYY with XXXX being the map's version number and YYYY being the revision).

6. Delete the old/existing map(s) folder(s) from your device. The name of the folder was shown in step 2.

7. Extract and copy the map(s) folder that you downloaded in step 5 to the root of the GPS device. This may take some time and it's best to walk away from the PC. TomTom devices have horribly slow and sometimes unreliable transfer rates. I had to unplug and retry copying over the map I wanted three times until it finally worked.

8. Once everything is copied over, open up FastActivate again. This time choose options 1 through 4 (Update Meta, Patch Maps..., Patch Navcore..., Patch TT Home), waiting for each step to complete before continuing to the next. Then choose option 6 (Update QuickGPSFix). Once finished you can close out FastActivate and disconnect your device.

Congrats, you just pirated a TomTom map!

You can also download voices, car icons, change the boot screen, battery low screen, ect. FastActivate will need to be used to activate voices and icons, some will just plain old refuse to work. My Dad uses John Cleese as his voice of choice.

Reply here if you have issues, I'll try and help out. Meanwhile, my 12 year old little Garmin nuvi 200w is still getting updates. I have to jump through a few hoops to get them (running Windows 98 in a VM that supports USB) but I do it every few years to keep the maps current.

EDIT: Windows XP, not Windows 98. And I have to use a VM because I haven't used Windows as my main OS in a long time.  Google maps on phone"
"Unpopular opinion, If I can not buy it new now, then it should not be on this sub.","I joined this sub for the purpose of buying stuff like lifetime warranty backpacks (osprey), great tools, camp gear, kitchen wear ect.  Yet this sub has basically became an Instagram for the old shit people find in they're grandparents house which offers no benefit to me now. I'm not going to buy, nor could I even find a kitchen aid mixer you grandma still uses from the 70s. Most stuff back then was made to last, we know that. I want stuff thats still made today with quality.



Edit new = available to purchase today, nothing against secondhand if its cheaper

There are still companies that are made the same way that are still operating they were back then. I get vintage thrift finds, if you look I made a satire post that gives an example of what I mean. I've seen these kind of threads pop up on here all the time for years. I don't think the mods have interest in changing the rules. This is obviously a hotly-debated topic with [everyone feeling very passionate](https://i.imgur.com/jNbvQfs.png) about their side, and certainly not an ""unpopular opinion"" judging by the 25k upvotes.

On one hand, photos of an old knife that isn't able to be purchased new gets a ton of upvotes.  It's very easy to for someone casually interested in BIFL stuff to see that on their main feed, upvote a cool photo with a backstory that fits in the title, and continue scrolling.

On the other hand, posts that allow people to buy or help people to learn about BIFL stuff are also important.  Knowing something is well-made and still available for purchase, or reviews on such items bring excellent information that we all benefit from since they help us find and continue using well-made gear.

Unfortunately, the nature of Reddit is that these types of high-quality posts tend not to get nearly as much attention from users because they're higher effort to digest, so the pictures of ""vintage"" finds tend to drown them out in Reddit's ""hotness"" algorithm that determines a post's visibility.

We've banned posts about things that aren't able to be currently bought new before.  And it resulted in a similarly-angry post to this one, except it complained that the subreddit had been inundated by photos of wool socks, cast iron, and thermoses because there wasn't much in the way of _unique_ content.

We recently tweaked the [flairing system](https://old.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/irfvtg/introducing_a_new_flair_system_for_the_bifl/) in hopes that it helps users who are more interested in certain types of posts to see those.  Filtering by flair is pretty cool.

As always, we're open to constructive recommendations on how to better manage this balance.  Please drop your comments below.

My 1988 Honda Accord daily driver. Everything on it still works. EVERYTHING.,"That is absolutely beautiful. I need proof you don't have a winker. I used to have one with the pop-up headlights and had to replace the mechanism that popped them up twice in 6 years. I briefly had my grandparents' 1987 Honda Accord that was the proverbial little old lady car. 

They bought it brand new, my grandpa absolutely babied it, maintained it meticulously, kept it in the garage almost all the time, etc. He passed away in 2012, and when my grandma passed away in 2013, it only had 58,000 miles on it. 

I inherited it, and took it to the Honda dealership for a once-over to make sure everything was in good working order. It drove like butter, and the interior was still pristine (no smoking, pets, eating in the car, etc.). In fact, one of the techs offered me $5k for it. I should have taken him up on it, but my ex and I were getting divorced, and it was supposed to go to him in the property settlement.  

My ex had never had a driver's license while we were married, so he had to get one after we split, and, I shit you not, he managed to blow up the engine the first time he drove it. I'm pretty sure he had it in second gear on the freeway, but the tow truck driver said he'd never seen anything like it. I still like to think that my grandparents were in the backseat going, ""No way in hell this schmuck is going to drive our car,"" lol."

Since we are doing clocks. Here is mine from the 90s.,"I miss the old 90s Nick style so much. It's a crime against nostalgia what happened to the Nickelodeon Studios at Universal, so I'm always stoked to see people keeping the artifacts of that time alive. 

Thanks for the throwback [deleted] Nick Nick Nick Nick na Nick Nick Nick... NICKELODEON!"

"I gave my dad this batman wallet 10 years ago, I was like 4 or 5 years old and I got it in preschool. He uses it to this day","He probably doesn't want a new one, he loves this one because you thought of him and you got it for him at such a young age, probably the first gift he got from you. Dude.  The wallet isn’t the issue.  Dad leaned in because it was from you.  Dad is “bifl”.  But you didn’t have to buy anything.  Good on him. The fact that someone is posting on Reddit and was 4 years old 10 years ago is making me uncomfortable."
Misen Knife was dropped resulting in the end snapping off. Misen no longer ship outside of the US so they gave me a full refund 4 years after purchase making good on their lifetime guarantee,"It's a shame as I really liked the knife. Will definitely buy a new one if they ever change their policy about international shipping, especially as they made good on their lifetime guarantee. Its misen the tip It's still a great chopping knife. Keep the knife and send it to a metal shop to reprofile. Would make a great veg chopper. Just get from the new point to quarter way in at the top ground into a nice curve."

My girlfriend's 1950s Frigidaire stove (which is replacing a far newer and much harder to fix stove).,"I'm convinced there is a market for semi-modernized DUMB appliances. I always thought it was funny that Frigidaire made stoves too. Like of all the appliances they could have put in their line, a stove is one thing that produces the opposite of frigid air.  Why a litter box in the kitchen though?"
Found this KitchenAid mixer from the 1970's for $35. New grease and paint and it's as good as new.,"What paint did you use? Our Kitchen aid mixer is from the '70s, actually the same color as your original.  Was my wife's folks.  We still use it nearly every week.

r/BIFL inspired me to buy a pair of Timberland Pro boots. The pair I bought was too small and their customer service offered to replace it with a bigger size for free. This is what came in the mail.,"Wal-Mart did this to us with a baby bouncer.   Supposed to send us 1 as a replacement and sent us a huge box containing 4.  They said keep them.  Everyone got baby bouncers for Christmas.  Didn't matter if you had kids or not. Baby bouncer forrrrrrr yoouuuuu  I have an update! I got a call from Timberland Pro. They reached out to me after they saw the Reddit post. They offered to take them back but, when I proposed giving them to needy charitable causes/orgs, they agreed. I am going to reach out to a shelter and a local org that helps refugees first and work from there!  Buy it for Life- *time supply"
1970 Buck Prince - Gift from my father. One of my kids broke the tip off the blade. Buck replaced blade and cleaned this baby up real nice. Normal blade replacement is $10. They gave me a “sentimental warranty” and charged me nothing. Honest to God BIFL!,"Did you trade the kid in for the repair? Companies that know they make quality products will typically go beyond their warranty period.

Leatherman is the same way. I  have 30 year old scar in the middle of my hand from one of those."
Stanley Thermos used every day from 1970 to 2018,"I know I've read that people say the offshored production and quality went down, but I bought mine probably 5+ years ago, which is after they apparently went offshore, and while 5 years isn't BIFL, there's been no damage or decrease in quality whatsoever. Can't beat it. I've worked night shift 5 hours from home a few times. Make coffee at noon before I leave home, pour my first cup at 11 pm, and it's still piping hot.  I bought a matte black one in February and I honestly don't know how I lived so long without one. What made you decide to swap out for a new one?"

r/Buy*ItForLife not r/Lasted*TillNow,"Recently this sub has gone from discussing products and brands that you can buy that will offer great longevity and quality, to people posting up old items that have survived until now that probably aren't all that relevant or useful today. Especially when the same brand now is not anywhere near the quality it may have once been which defeats the purpose of this sub. Your 1950s blender is cool and might have lasted until now with minimal use, but that doesn't mean the same brand/product today will offer the same kind of quality which defeats the purpose of this sub. I think these types of posts belong in a sub more devoted to nostalgia or oldschoolcool. Agree/disagree, I'm just one person with an opinion. I agree OP. I subscribed to this subreddit to see what types of products that I could typically purchase that would be worth the extra money to buy a more premium or specific brand/model.

So far, it's just been nothing but gear shots from the 40s and 50s, for products that we can't reasonably buy anymore in any condition, and certainly not new.

If that's all BIFL is going to be, I'll just take it out of my feed. /r/sofarsogood It's kind of survivorship bias, which is why I hate seeing those posts. Neat, your old as fuck blender managed to survive 50 years. That doesn't mean 99% of the rest of that type of blender did. It doesn't mean old products are better. There's plenty of old junk that probably still functions sitting around in garbage dumps."
"About 80 years old. Hand me down cast iron skillet, used daily.","That has a better finish than my car, you must polish it with a buffer!

Our treasured family heirloom - Arby’s 1985 Christmas Collection glassware. All 30 pieces still intact and used every holiday.,"“Break out the good Arby’s glasses, we got company” These originally belonged to my in-laws. I first met them when my girlfriend (now wife) invited me to their home for Christmas. During dinner, I commented on their festive glassware, and my future father-in-law beamed with pride:

Father-in-law: ""I ate a *lot* of roast beef sandwiches for those glasses.""

Mother-in-law: ""He's very proud (eye roll).""

Father-in-law: ""She teases, but I'll tell ya, of all the things I've bought this woman over the years - jewelry, fine crystal - these Christmas glasses are her favorite.""

USSR-made stopwatch; still in daily use at my physiology lab,"[deleted] I've bought two different Pobeda wrist watches and they both broke. So I personally have some reservations about Soviet watches.  Interesting that it says ""Made in USSR"" in English. I wonder why that is? The USSR states didn't trade with the West frequently, they really only traded a tiny bit with the US for some grain (to feed animals, and produce meat to imitate western lifestyles) and Japan a bit. Maybe it's best English was the language of science, and for scientists in the USSR they participated in the international scientific community?"
"Not really what the sub is about, but I figured it was in the spirit.","Old Corningware > New Corningware My mom just gifted me a huge set of vintage 70’s Corningware.

When I first came to America I had a kind old woman as my neighbor. We became friendly, as she spoke deutsch quite well! She gave me several of these dishes and then one day she had a fall and her children sent her to a nursing home where she died of covid. I tried to find these dishes in many stores, but I could not. Now I know that I must check thrift stores. Thanks op!"
"Rage-inducing, unnecessary EOL from Spotify","I bought the Spotify Car Thing for my daughter a few years ago. It is a silly piece of tech, like a second control screen for your phone. You connect it with Bluetooth and it shows what is playing and lets you skip songs and pick from your top playlists. 

Yesterday, they shut it down. To be clear, they didn’t just stop selling them, they bricked every one that they had ever sold.

There is nothing in the feature set that required a service. It worked by connecting to your phone like a Bluetooth headset. There was some minimal API support by the Spotify app to operate the controls, but nothing that would require connection to the cloud. The actual Spotify app had to run on your phone for it to work.

What the heck is that even? I absolutely hate the tech industry Annoying, but at least they released the software, modders are having a field day, and there are plenty of software versions now for various uses. Some let it function as intended, while others allow you to install custom controls and other music sources.

Plenty of video tutorials if you google car thing mod on youtube. Otherwise, they are offering full refunds. Harbinger of things to come I feel like no one is understanding your point. It’s one thing to stop making it. Why make the ones they have completely un-usable? It wasn’t hurting them to let people keep using the ones that they have OR get a refund by returning."

A customer of mine came in for help with her voicemail…,"Last year around this time I posted an old Motorola Razr one of my customers was finally upgrading from, purchased November 2006.

"These Russian Valenki felted wool boots, made entirely out of hardened wool that served me so well here in Texas in ver the past couple days. No soles, no form, basically like wearing snow proof 2 inch thick hard wool socks. Had them for 5 years, no sign of wear.","I am Russian, and I upvote! 
I was born in Russian North and wore those when I was little. It used to get below -40C (-40F), so these were a must as well as ushanka hat! These are the real deal.

At first, just by looking at it, it doesn't looks like good winter boots and it doesn't look waterproof either but these were the only boots that worked in -40°C.

1939 Snap-On ratchet I found in the desert about 15 years ago.,"Extra impressive when you realize it was used in a murder and ditched in the desert [deleted] My grandfather got through the Great Depression selling Snap-On tools in Wisconsin. He would drive around and loan tools to mechanics. Then he’d come back a week later and ask for them back, and often they’d buy them instead. He said they were that good that it was all he had to do to sell them, even during a terrible time to be in sales. 

He kept his expenses down by sleeping at work, and as the company boomed after WWII he did very well for himself. He was with Snap-On until his retirement, and I think of him every time I see a Snap-On truck go by."
BuyItForLife will be going dark June 12-14 in protest of Reddit's absurd API pricing that will kill third-party apps.,"For more context, read through [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps) and some of the links within, or check out [this graphic](https://i.redd.it/ujhebpg9ub4b1.jpg).

**TL;DR:** Reddit is going to start charging absurd amounts for their API access.  Like ""would cost the biggest third-party app $20M/month"" absurd.  The users are the ones who provide the content, which in turn gives the site any value at all. As posted on a lot of subs: why only 3 days? A week or indefinitely sends a stronger message Saw a good theory, they're going to appear to ""back down"" by charging something much more reasonable but it was just way to get us to accept charging for the API. I use the unofficial app I use because it hides posts I've already seen so I don't see repeats. If I lose that feature I genuinely will stop using Reddit, it's far too tedious to have to scroll past the same posts over and over."
Anyone else still have a working Pizzazz?,"I’m nearly 50 and got this thing in college. Has made approximately 6,743,221 frozen pizzas. Still crankin em out. 🤘 My dad bought one when I lived at home. They still use it. It has to be 20+ years old now. My dad cooked everything on it. The bagged frozen french fries come out perfect on it. It has seen hash browns, fish sticks, corn dogs, chicken tenders, pizza rolls. You name it.

Its really good when you're drunk watching your pizza slowly spin and adding ingredients while you get hungrier and hungrier. Mine is still used. When my wife and I first moved in together 20 years ago we were broke and figured we could splurge a bit and spend the $50 on this because it would end up saving us money eating cheap tombstones. Drove to three different stores till we found one. Life has changed a lot since then, but we still fire up that same pizzazz. My roommate right after college put the whole thing in the dishwasher…. It still worked for 5 years after that until I lost it in a move. I swear it was stolen."
Update on my $5 thrift store Allen Edmond shoes. Spent the afternoon focusing on the right shoe just to get this picture. They had some deep discoloration so I decided to re-dye since I don’t have any dark brown shoes,"For anyone wondering, my process was:

1. Brush the shit out of them

2. Apply Saphir Reno Mat to clean the deeper dirt out

3. Cleaned with Saddle soap

4. Realize there’s some dark discoloration that doesn’t want to come out

5. Couple coats of Fiebings Light Brown leather dye. I played around in different sections with the thickness of the coats to see what kind of interesting color I could get

6. 2 coats of Saphir renouvateur

7. 4 coats of Saphir medaille d’or Cognac cream polish

8. I tried putting a coat of Lincoln Mahogany wax polish on but couldn’t get it to rub in cause of all the other stuff done to it today so I took my horse hair brush and brushed the shit out of it

Tomorrow I’ll hit it with a couple coats of the Lincoln polish to really get it shining A shoe repairer is like God. He can heel you. He can save your sole. And he can even dye for you GREAT find. They're probably from when AE was still an american company. Send them to AE and they will resole, repair, and polish them. Also, use cedar shoe trees vs plastic"

I've put together a quick 'forever outfit'. It only includes clothes/accessories which have a lifetime guarantee.,"Am I supposed to go commando for life?  [removed] About the Nudie Jeans:

A couple of years ago I decided I was fed up with the usual Levis 501 I had been wearing for decades, due to their decrease in build quality and how often they were wearing out and developing tears. 

I researched denim online, found out about raw denim, selvedge denim, heavier denim, etc and decided that was the way to go, surely a heavier denim, in raw form  would last longer. After all, people were claiming to wear them for up to 2 years without washing. Found me some Raw Selvedge denim from Nudie Jeans (Steady Eddie cut, if thats important to you) and bought a couple of pairs.

Fast forward a couple of years and I now have 6 pairs of torn/worn out Nudie Jeans (all raw, no stretch skinny-fit crap), some repaired and re-torn.

Their free repair is a nice idea, if you live in one of the cities with their official stores (I live in a European capital, but no store with that service here), but how many times can you repair a pair of jeans before they start to look like crap and can only wear them on your time off? It was less than a year before I needed to fix the first pair. The free repair kit they offer is a nice gift, but the repairs you make with it are not going to last that long, unless you have a sewing machine or are a very talented sewer.

As a reference, I am not some crazy extreme sports enthusiast, but do wear jeans every day. I work at an office, but do, on occasion, have to crawl under desks or get my hands a bit dirty (IT), so I would say I dont exactly give unreasonable abuse to the fabric.

Tl/dr: Jeans will not last forever if you wear them every day, and you can only repair them so many times before they start looking like patchwork. Nudie Jeans are not BIFL, maybe buy for a year and a half.

My Sheaffer Reminder ballpoint pen. This has been in my pocket every weekday for the last 15 years. It used to belong to my grand-father. I know he used it because the brass was already starting to wear through when I got it. They still make the refills for it.,I love it. I would’ve lost it ages ago.  I am amazed that the clip is still attached.  Usually the first thing to go. [deleted]
I'm working seasonally for UPS and someone left the best present ever on their porch!!!,Almost identical to the ones I'm wearing. [deleted] Doing deliveries in your Gen1 Volt? That's a good way to save gas!
Bought those Haglöfs boots on my 18th birthday. This week I celebrated my 50th birthday.,I've never seen boots like this before.  This is very cool.  How many times have they been re- soled?  I've got many shoes which are multiple years old but you're doing great to make those last so long!  The most enduring thing I have is a pair of flipflops from oulukai and a pair of 1000 mile wolverine boots which don't get worn that much. Those are some well loved boots! Do these double as cross country ski boots or something? What's with the duck toe?
My 97 year old waterman 52.,"[deleted] There is a woman at Mont Blanc that has the sole duty of testing each and every pen they produce.

"Me with the Golden Taco the day I bought it vs 4 years later... Still ticking with 530,000 miles!","In 2021, 14 year old me bought the Golden Taco for $600 and a firm handshake with the intentions of making it a project car. That never happened though since it never needed the major repairs I thought it would eventually need. Other than minor repairs here and there, the Golden Taco just keeps going and going. 
 

 Not only is it reliable, it is insanely good at offroading. With a factory suspension and body it got me through the batona trail and the pine barrens multiple times without getting stuck once, even on very muddy days. It KILLS ME that they refuse to make genuinely small trucks like this anymore. 
Seriously, what if I don't own a boat or want everyone around me to think I've got a lot of money?  What if the biggest thing I ever plan on hauling is like....a mattress? 

Sigh. I want one so bad.  Take care of that beauty. For those of us that don’t know trucks. What is the make and model? Dude hell yes! I have a 97’ 4Runner that I got for $750 in 2012.

Bought this North Face jacket in back in 2013 and it’s still going strong as my work winter jacket,"I had a women's version like that- The Fembot. I *just* mailed it back this year bc the magnet buttons fell off, and they gave me the full amount back in a gift card. That's nice . The older north face were much better quality imo. Especially the 1990s stuff. What model is that ? I like it. I feel like NorthFace gets slammed here a lot and just had to share this. I’ve worn this jacket for 10 years now and it’s the warmest winter jacket I’ve ever owned. It does show a bit of wear at the wrist area and the Velcro’s straps are slightly worn out now. I’ve since upgraded jackets and bought an Arc’teryx Thorsen parka and also own a Patagonia Barn coat that I layer with. Although they’re fancier  than this jacket they don’t come close in terms of warmth. It’s actually so hot that I don’t even bring it out until the weather hits -15C anymore. Today I wore it in -23C with a feels like of -30C after the windchill and I only wore a long sleeve shirt underneath. 

I’ll say though that I do understand some of the hate this brand gets. Three years ago I was shopping for a new winter jacket since I wanted a parka style instead and decided to go with North Face again. I don’t remember the name of the jacket but I ordered it only and returned it the following day because the build quality and warmth didn’t even come close to this one. I ended up buying the Arc’teryx Thorsen Parka. I love that jacket a lot and it’s very stylish but I’d be cold in anything colder lower than -15C if I didn’t wear a sweater underneath

Waffle Iron from the 1920's still working flawlessly.,"Can you please share your batter recipe for waffles? I've got waffle maker two days ago and failed I making nice waffles...

"Unpopular Opinion: ""BIFL"" as an excuse for overspending","I've followed the subreddit for a while. I suspect that there are a lot of people here who have had poor self control in regards to money and spending in the past. And that they are adopting a new ""BIFL"" attitude as an excuse to continue buying things that they cannot afford, by justifying its lifetime value. 

Let's face it, no clothing is ""for life"". Fashions change, your body gets bigger or smaller, and some things that you wear in your 20s and 30s just look out of place later in life. Even the idea that you're buying something to hand down to a future generation is very presumptuous, especially when you consider all of the things that are in our parents' homes that we want nothing to do with.

Regards to home appliances, if the item hasn't broken yet it's pretty wasteful and irresponsible to go out and buy a new, bifl, expensive version just so you can throw away the old one. 

This does not apply to everyone and everything, but having spent a few years living in a country where the quality of consumer goods is much lower than in the United States, and everyone survived just fine, I'm finding that this sub sometimes devolves into unhealthy consumerism. Some people seem to have the idea that there is a silver bullet, and that once they replace every item in their life with its bifl equivalent they will somehow be satisfied and free from want. But it doesn't work like that!
 The best example of this were the $60 measuring cups from the other day. I’ve often suspected that this sub is a garden for guerrilla marketing. The datapoint you may be missing is the participants in each thread differ.   There are nearly 3 million people subbed and they all have different things they’re aware of that could be BIFL. 

Sure, there are common themes, brands, groupthink, etc - but I *highly* doubt even 10% of posters here are running out and buying everything recommended on this sub.  

I use this sub as a research tool, one of many, when it’s time to replace something.  

Dishwasher takes a shit?   I come here and see what common consensus is, then go see the machine or read reviews elsewhere.   

Looking for a new piece of luggage because it got destroyed on the conveyor on my last flight?  This sub is one stop I make to find a new one.  

As you rightly pointed out, not everyone falls for frivolous spending and mass consumerism - but I think you’re wrong assuming the majority do."

My family has been using the same SNO-TUBES since 1994. Still holding air in 2025!,"Do they still make these or something of similar quality? I’ve just got the plastic discs which are fine but they arent great for fluffy snow. That graphic is peak 90’s We had these growing up, I love it"
BIFL clothing: you’re doing laundry wrong,"My family and I all buy similar quality clothing. Not cheap SHEIN crap but not high quality by any means. Mine lasts 10X longer than theirs for one simple reason: we do laundry differently. If you want clean clothes and to make it last, here are some simple tips. 

1. Always wash on cold, extra rinse, less detergent. From following r/cleaningtips for years I’ve learned how it’s truly the rinse cycles that get your clothes clean and washes the suds and grime out. Cold works just as well as hot with smaller loads and/or extra rinse cycles. It will save you money too!

2. Avoid your drier like the plague. It’s super convenient but breaks your clothing down. It’s best to hang it up to dry, you can buy sturdy metal drying racks that very well may be your most BIFL clothes-related purchase over time. Anecdotally, this is the absolute best thing you can do to extend the life of your clothing. It’s will save you money too! Another one: wash your clothes inside out. Being in the washer or dryer causes a lot of friction against your clothes from them rubbing on each other, so turning them inside out prevents this from wearing down the part that people see and causing things like visible pilling. I do the same but I air fluff my clothes for about 10 mins. No heat. Gets the lint, dirt, and per hair off that didn’t come off in the wash. Huh. Well then. I’ve always wondered what people mean about cheap clothes not lasting, when I have budget clothes/second hand that I’ve owned for 10+ years.

Turns out my natural cheapness (too cheap to own a dryer, too cheap to wash with hot water) has preserved my clothes."
FFS STOP POSTING YOUR OLD SHIT!,"I know this may be beating a dead horse, but this sub needs a serious intervention to get back on track. There is so much semi-useless old shit being posted here that completely ignores the intent.

Just because it's lasted a lifetime, doesn't mean we care. I have no interest in an AM radio that has been out of production for 45 years just because your grandma still uses it everyday. Who the fuck needs an AM radio? And if you did need an AM radio, you're certainly not going searching for the model that has sat on your grandmas kitchen counter for half a century.

This is not a sub to post functional antiques, it is for products that are DURABLE, PRACTICAL, PROVEN, and made to last. One example of something lasting does not constitute proven. And many things used 50+ years ago are no longer practical today. Perhaps most importantly, it is called BUYitforlife. You should be able to reasonably BUY the products being posted, whether that is new or on the used market.

I'm not sure if we need better moderation, refreshed rules, or just a sticky describing what this whole thing is about, but something needs to change. This sub use to be an interesting place to see what kind of durable, useful products are available that may improve my life. Now it's mostly just useless antiques that someone found cleaning out their attic.

HELP!

Edit: Woooo gold! Thanks for validating the rantings of a mad man.

Edit2: I'm getting a lot of replies that are taking the Life part of BIFL way too literally. To quote rule #1 ""Products that are well-made and durable (even if they won't last a lifetime) are accepted"".

My replacement ‘For Life’ Dr Martens next to the old pair. I highly recommend this service.,"[deleted] I owned a pair of For Life black oxfords ($140 new purchased directly from Dr. Martens website) for about two years.  The first pair lasted 9 months before the soles cracked all the way through.  $20 to ship them back to Oregon, six weeks of waiting, $25 admin fee for a replacement pair that lasted me about 10 months before those soles cracked all the way through.  Another $20 shipping, another six weeks of waiting, and another $25 admin fee for a new replacement.

I ended up selling the second replacement pair on eBay for $80 and promised the new buyer I would help him out with the warranty if he needed to use it in the future (he will).

Would not buy again.  The For Life line is still not made to a very good standard (certainly not as good as the old UK models) and they were one of the stiffest, hardest, most uncomfortable pair a shoes I ever owned.

On a positive note, the uppers were flawless and even after repeated use never showed even the slightest sign of wear.
 I have a pair that are far from needing replacing, but I thought the guarantee was only for soles? How did you manage a whole new pair?! Awesome!"

Looks like it's LG and Kenmore for this one. Samsung should be included in this too, but it's not.

Edited to shorten link A huge issue is the lack of parts even a few years after the fridge goes out of production. With so many electronics, that effectively forces you to buy a new fridge. 

Try to avoid complicated appliances with lots of electronics. That is increasingly difficult to do. Redid the kitchen a few years ago.  As part of it, we swapped out the old tiny fridge for a much bigger one (with fridge on top for our 6' tall household).  

Sales rep was showing us some new models, saying things like ""This one is great, you'll easily get 8-10 years out of it""  

I nearly shat myself.  We moved into this place 10 years ago, and that fridge was easily 10 years old already.  The only thing we've put into that 20 year old fridge has been food, and this one's going to crap out in 10? the fraud part of this case is interesting because most definitely by this point yes, every retailer would know about the LG failures and yes, they continue to sell them to consumers knowingly"

Just a small word of warning: I see you are using it with a nest. Those increase the risk of SIDS/suffocation, so it would be more safe without. [Here is the CDC guideline on safe sleep](https://www.cdc.gov/sids/Parents-Caregivers.htm). I’m in Europe and we are advised to have a flat surface (which this is), firm mattress, and a sleeping bag and/or (depending on the room’s temperature) a sheet or firm blanket such as a wool blanket, that is securely tucked in, no higher than chest (under the armpits) height when the child’s feet hit the bottom of the bed. If the cradle was ever refinished make sure you test the cradle for lead as it was very common up until the 1970s to be included in many paints and finishes. 

Ditto on the suffocation hazards of added pad material and the ability for the cradle to rock and wedge the child into the walls. Definetly an item that requires constant supervision. I thought the comments would be more overwhelmingly about the unsafe sleep conditions. 

I’ll just add one detail — the main risk you have right now is not SIDS; just plain suffocation."

"BuyItForLife users have lost their way, this is not /r/frugal, nor was it intended to be","I've been a lurker here for as long as I've had an account on reddit (ten years), this sub was one of the reasons I got one in the first place. Things change over time of course and user perception ebbs and flows, but the most recent change I've recognized is the crossover between frugal and anti-consumption rhetoric. 

I implore anyone to read /u/Petrarch1603's mission statement from *thirteen years ago* on why they developed the subreddit in the first place: https://old.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jtjuz/bi4l_mission_statement_rules_etc/

One thing you will not find is a single note about consumption, a single note about discussing what people should do with their things, how they should buy something for life. 

A **direct quote** from the mission statement:

>BI4L is intended to fill a niche for only high quality and durable products.

It's equal parts disheartening and annoying when posts come up with people asking for recommendations and half the people in the thread just say, ""keep it"", snarky references to cost or everyone's favorite sock brand. I get it, consumption is bad, capitalism bad, all that - hell I even agree with you. With that said you:

1. Do not know anyone's situation, financial background, needs outside of a product assumption.
2. Don't exist in a place where time is a vacuum, sadly things do die, technology changes, science is updated, and so on - there are more reasons to buy something than wanting a rolex to flex on interns. These people aren't out to get you, they want to know what you like in a product category so they might like it to, this benefits *you*. 

Ultimately, I miss the way this was - there are no shortage of anti-consumption, anti-capitism, anti-w/e subs out there and I encourage you to join them. This one was never meant to be one of them, if that's changed then the rules and mission statement should change with them. 

At the end of the day, I just want to be able to see what kinds of pans and shit people are fucking with without needing a multi-paragraph rendition of Brave New World. I'm good y'all, I'm in the echo chamber, I don't come here for that - I come here to learn about **products**. It’s depressing how dated this quote feels:
> I think Amazon is the best place because it is relatively easy to purchase from there and the reviews are somewhat more trustworthy.

TBF it is super easy to purchase from Amazon but I just do not trust their reviews any more and there are so many fakes ""The quality of this sub used to be great, but they don't make the posts like they used to"" is the most ""BIFL"" thread ever! One aspect that remains ambiguous in this sub concerns high quality consumables or these days, items with batteries.

I don't know any professional builder who still uses wired hand drills or wired impact drills, outside of speciality drills (like for extreme work). At the moment, posts about drills degrade into a discussion of whether tools with a lithium battery can be ""for life"" and yet I would argue that it's probably the place to ask."

Across all of these, Shark is the most recommended brand for upright vacuums.

I go over to Reddit and find that Shark is a brand people should avoid. All the Shark-related discussion on [r/VacuumCleaners](https://www.reddit.com/r/VacuumCleaners/) that includes detailed comments from vacuum repair technicians say that Sharks are built to fail with no replacement parts available.

Instead, people on Reddit recommend brands like Sebo, Kenmore, and Hoover for upright vacs. These products perform well, are easy to repair, and last long. I suggest checking out the [buying guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/VacuumCleaners/wiki/recommendedvacuums) on r/VacuumCleaners.

I also find out that Vacuum Wars is [sponsored by Shark](https://www.reddit.com/r/VacuumCleaners/comments/l8dibh/vacuum_wars_loves_shark_but_why/), which is really disappointing because it destroys the trustworthiness of what could be an excellent source for vacuum reviews.

Apart from the misalignment between commercial interest and honest product recommendations, review sites that actually test products fail because they don't have the capacity to test products in-depth year-over-year. 

In contrast, people on Reddit live with these products on an ongoing basis. The small group of people who are passionate about these products and want to have honest discussions find themselves on a subreddit like r/VacuumCleaners. I end all my ""best blahblah"" searches with ""reddit"" to avoid the fake pages that fund themselves with Amazon links.

Found this Griswald 10 pan in someone's garbage 2 years ago. It hasn't left my stove since,it blows my mind that people throw out cast iron. I found a big cast iron dutch oven at a yard sale about 10 years ago. $3 was all they wanted they said if it didn't sell they were throwing it out.

Recently restored this old girl. A 1990 something Weber Genesis 3000. Made in the USA.,"Beautiful.  Were you the original owner or did you buy it from a yard sale or something?

Weber is my favorite company (seems to be the only company to make a grill that won't rust out in a year in my high humidity environment) but I hate how their modern propane grill has no character and is so expensive.  (I own and heavily modified a bunch of their charcoal grills and smokers though)

I've been thinking of starting a project like this because Im pretty sure you can do it for less than the cost of their new propane grill This grill has sat on my parents back porch for at least 15 years and still works great, I don't even think there is any damage to the plastic wheels. I’ve done exactly this. Father in law was throwing his away and bought a cheap ass charbroil as a replacement. I saved it from the curb and it was the best $300 in replacement parts I’ve ever spent.

"In 2002, in 9th grade, I took a drafting class that required me to buy this pencil. I have used it in every single exam in every class at every level of schooling since. I'm 35 and finishing a PhD, and it's still the only pencil for me!

I use [eraser sticks](https://www.amazon.com/Staedtler-Mars-Stick-Erasers-STD52850/dp/B00A9UEVUQ) so that I don't have to mess with the piddly little crap erasers these things tend to have, and I have so many memories of sitting down to take an exam and pulling out my GraphGear, my eraser stick, my little container of graphite in case I write more than expected, and my TI-84 and lining them up on the top right of my desk while waiting for the class to begin and the instructor to hand out the tests. The fact I still have the little metal bit that covers the eraser *and* the metal clasp that I regularly would snap on and off if I felt nervous in a test is an absolute miracle! The knurling still feels great, it writes like a dream. I love this pencil. I have seen my parents use a similar pencil, both were architects.

They duct taped the final part of the ""handler"" (where it becomes metallic) cuz after long use it hurts your fingers Old draftsman here. I made a very good living with this pencil in multiple sizes with several types of lead. All of them still work."
1934 Chicago mansion still has its original Jewett custom built-in refrigerator,"From what I found in a few minutes searching, Jewett started out building ice boxes, with this same door hardware. They stayed in business into the late 50s, and did indeed also build morgue refrigerators. So, it's not so much that these doors look like morgue doors, but that morgue doors look like these doors--these came first. The nice thing about fridges like that is that you can update the compressor and condenser, and keep the original look. It’s common on older, high end homes to do just that. That is an elegant kitchen that has stood the test of time. I could serve 1000 people from it."
Going on twenty years. (Sorel),"**Caveat Emptor:** Unfortunately, recent manufacture Sorel boots are **NOT BIFL.** I highly urge people to think long and hard about whether they want to risk frostbite or a ruined trip because of these shoddy boots. Sorel was bought by Columbia (NASDAQ: COLM), along with Mountain Hardware, and prAna and are now manufactured in China and Vietnam.

**Anecdotally:** I received a pair of these exact Sorel Conquest boots as a 2019 Xmas gift. The welt ripped out where it attaches to the outsole which ripped down to the lug. Trying to get a warranty honored without a receipt has been a nightmare and their offshore customer support shuffles you from department to department while the measly 60 day warranty ticks away.

I personally know someone who had a very similar issue with recent manufacture Mountain Hardware mittens which catastrophically failed on a hunting trip, so this is not a one-off issue. These brands are most definitely **NOT BIFL.** Do not buy Sorel boots, they are junk now. Paid a lot of money for a pair of Caribous thinking I was making a lifetime investment. The rubber cracked in many places during my first season wearing them. Reached out to the company and didn't even get a reply... Have you had to replace the liners?  Know of a good website or store to get some?"

"""An advertisement essentially telling their customers to not buy a new jacket"" was not on my 2024 bingo card but here we are","This is why we like Patagonia, eh? This kind of advertising really works on me—when someone who could sell me a new thing chooses not to in service of reusing or repairing what I have, it wins my respect.

Happy birthday to our refrigerator that turned 99 years old this month! She’s still going strong.,"If this was made in the 1920s and hasn't had its refrigerant replaced it actually probably doesn't use freon or any other ozone damaging CFCs as those weren't invented and used in refrigerators until the 1930s. It more likely uses ammonia, sulfur dioxide, or chloromethane. On the upside these chemicals are not long-term damaging to the environment, on the downside they range from slightly toxic to very toxic if they leak in an enclosed area. That's awesome!

One word of unsolicited advice - get it rewired (or have a electrician at least give it a once over). A friend had one like that, they loved all things vintage. Electrical fire from the fridge burned their house down, lost everything during the holidays a few years back. He had it and used it for decades, then in the middle of the night one day poof. Escaped in their PJs and nothing else. 

Of course it can happen with any appliance, but modern appliances have some additional failsafe measures. Does it have a born on date?"

This GPS has been in my family for 10+ years.

Incredibly impressive behavior from Patagonia,"About a decade ago, I bought a puffer from Patagonia. I have used it a LOT — I would guess I’ve worn this jacket over 1000 times. Twice over the years I’ve brought it in for repairs, and both times they did it free of charge.

Brought it in again yesterday, after a couple more rips from wear exposed themselves. The people at the store said it was likely too far gone (it’s hard to replace down, and most of it had leaked out). So they gave me store credit of the FULL VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL JACKET. Bought an identical model and boy is a coat with all its down a lot warmer, lol This is why probably 50% of my wardrobe is Patagonia. We live near a brick and mortar and they even use local shops to stitch my gear back up, rather than shipping it out somewhere else. Similar experience.  Went in for a zipper repair and walked out with a new jacket. We did not ask or expect anything like that. This kind of service is how you get customers for life. I should me tipn, I have no affiliation whatsoever with this company.....just a happy customer. A couple years ago I was running while wearing a Patagonia jacket and took a nasty fall. I ended up with a large hole/tear on the sleeve. I took it in to see if they could repair it, fully expecting to have to pay for it since it was my fault. The guy at the counter looked at it, and told me to go grab a new one off the rack. 

Sometimes Patagonia's version of a piece of clothing isn't what I'm looking for, but if it is they are 100% my first choice."

Do you have any posts of the former that's not the standard darn tough socks, Stanley themos, and naglene water bottle? TBF, most BIFL stuff has always been survivorship bias. Well, I haven't had it for life to personally confirm it, but if I had to choose something recently bought that I *expect* is BIFL, it would be my Osprey backpack. Quite a lot of stuff made for a professional environment, really. We use Bose aviation headsets at work and they're nearly indestructible compared to the consumer-grade QuietComfort series.

Actually, now that I think about it, almost any professional-grade live audio equipment is going to last a *long* time. Most of it is incredibly sturdy and not particularly complicated.

Makes sense, a pair of jogging pants for $160+ should last at least a few years of regular use without the seams popping. In the early 2010's I had many pairs of pants and never needed to warranty them.

Over the last few years as quality has decreased, I've needed to warranty almost every pair of pants due to inner thigh seams fraying and popping open.

Well, as of this April, Lululemon has officially acknowledged the significant decease in the product quality by changing their warranty from a lifetime guarantee all the way down to a single year with receipt. No receipt or just over a year? Too bad, no warranty for you. As a long time customer it's just very disappointing. LLL is considered fast fashion now, so this tracks. I hate that “fast fashion” has permeated into EVERYTHING Wow, that’s absolutely ridiculous. I’ve avoided them for a while now due to declining quality but very disappointing to know they don’t offer lifetime repairs anymore."
Just been gifted my parents Le Creuset saucepan set. They got it as a wedding gift 40 years ago. Has had everyday use since,"Gorgeous.  Those wooden handles might benefit from some love, though.

My inlaws’ Pyrex bowls that my wife grew up with. Wedding present from 1970. The only thing she asked for when her parents asked her what she wanted from their estate. One used to be pink. Used daily.,"The Pyrex of today is most certainly not the Pyrex of old.

Scooped an authentic navy-issue pea coat at Goodwill the other day. This thing weighs a ton and feels absolutely bulletproof. It’s easy to see what sets mil-spec quality from the retail class.,"Yeah I’ve got one of those bad boys, reinforce the buttons and check the seams from time to time Don’t be fooled by things labeled “military-quality.” You’d be shocked at how disposable some navy items are. That being said, the pea coat is the most durable thing ever. It cost something like $250 at our uniform shop I picked up the same coat for about £20 in the UK (no idea how it ended up here, it's legit US Navy with some sailor's name stamped inside), best jacket I ever bought. Incredibly warm, looks good, really well made."
"Restoring the wooden beams of my house and found this. (More like ""Buy it for the next 6 generations"")",That's older than my country My house was built in 1820 but nobody was proud enough of their craftsmanship (rightfully so) to engrave any of the beams ... Where is this?
"Another testament to the quality of Herman Miller Chairs. I got this one at an office liquidation, only to find out it was manufactured in 1999. Still in great shape with no issues.","This!  Got tired of buying a new chair every few years, and recently got a refurbished one.  Pricey, but they last a long time and I spend a lot of time at my desk. my main problem with herman millers is that the seat has the plastic casing that goes all the way around. I find that in the front, this digs in to my legs and is uncomfortable for long sitting sessions.

I really like my steelcase think though

"Finally found a genuine used Irvin flying jacket with a beautiful patina that is the perfect fit: couldn't afford a new one ($1000+) and I'll be keeping this for a long, long time. So damned warm!","I'm gonna throw this out here for what it's worth, but the ones that the military still issues today are like $700 each.... They'll last forever, but they're kinda clunky and stiff.

... HOWEVER, there is a guy named Chang that runs a leather shop outside of Osan AFB in Korea. Just about every military pilot in the Navy or Air Force knows who he is, and he's renowned for making the best jackets.

They're ≈$350 custom tailored to your measurements including shipping to the US.

They're the real deal. It's like a pilgrimage to Mecca for pilots to finally find your way to Chang's shop to get a jacket made. I have one, and it's the nicest piece of kit I own. It fits perfect, has a fancy liner, a zip-out fur liner, my name embroidered, a super soft fire collar, and warm lined pockets.

edit: sorry guys, I went to sleep after making this post last night. Didn't realize it would be so popular! Yeah, darkhorse is the place. [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/bVbyM6p) is an album of my jacket, comparing it to the issued jacket, as well as the ordering info. He makes TONS  of issued style jackets to order (he told me around 1,000 a year, not sure how true that is), but when I was in his shop I saw all sorts of different style jackets he could make.

edit 2: also I should add that Chang isn't the only guy in that town that makes leather jackets. There's a few others that people like as well, I just don't have any experience with them. That whole city makes custom *everything*. I had some custom made leather shoes and such made while I was there too, but the shoe place doesn't even have a public phone number unfortunately.

edit 3: He makes other jackets than just the regular issue jackets too. I saw a number of motorcycle and custom designed jackets in his shop. I'm sure if you showed him a photo of what you wanted, he could make something damn near identical.

Edit 4: Since this took off, I emailed Chang and let him know about this thread, and invited him here. I doubt he'll actually show up on Reddit, but now at least he knows that there's a potential storm coming.

Edit 5: I appreciate the gold guys. One more thought: PLEASE specify your fit to him, even with measurements. He's used to making things to an ""american"" fit, if you know what I mean. If you want something tighter/slimmer/shorter....please let him know, because he might assume that you want a ""comfortable"" fit, which can be a little bulky. For my jacket, I specified that I wanted it a little tight and short, but I didn't specify anything in the shoulders. He left a little extra room in the shoulders, which makes it easy to get the jacket on and off, and in a uniform looks good, but in regular clothes may be a bit big. Where did you find an affordable one? I think the show, The Repair Shop (Netflix) just featured one of these being restored. It looks quite similar.

Edit: yes, I was correct. The episode is in Season 3, titled Meissen Clock, Typewriter, Bomber Jacket. It is the 11th out of 15 episodes in that season."

a pair of Levis from 1880 found after a mine shaft was discovered,"Riveted suspender buttons instead of belt loops! The raggedy miner style is still in fashion today. I've heard about this before, people finding old Levi's in mines,  It kind of makes me wonder just what the heck was going on in them mines that so many miners came back up from underground without their pants.."
This community has become the epitome of “they don’t make things like they used to”. No one here actually talks about modern products that can be bought for life.,"Basically every single popular post on here is about some product from 20+ years ago that is still going strong today. Why can’t we talk more about high quality products that are available now??

Edit: Ok I guess I wasn’t very clear the first time around. I understand that the only thing that can prove whether something can be bought for life is TIME!! However, I wish that this sub was less about reminiscing over how amazing things from 20+ years ago were, and more about discussing somewhat recent finds that have proved to be great quality and durable. I get that’s there’s always a chance that something we think will last us a lifetime suddenly breaks and disappoints us, but that doesn’t stop us from talking about products from maybe five to ten years ago that are still going strong!! For example, I bought a hydro flask three years ago and the thing is still like new. Most water bottles that can be bought these days are crap and would last me a year tops. However, I’m glad I’ve been able to find a good quality bottle that has/will last me a long time. I guess the most frustrating part is how I see many things on here that are out of production or discontinued, so it all kind of feels counterproductive... I think it would be great with more buying guides and more about how to spot something quality and maybe even how to repair it!

Edit: Thank you for my first silver ever, kind stranger! Everyone is complaining about how there needs to be time to pass, but how about the first word of the subreddit: **buy**. Anything that cannot be currently bought also doesn't fit into this sub. No one comes here to see your grandpa's iron that has been sitting in an attic for 15 years.

Samsung washer and dryer literally fell apart machine died so I upgraded to Speed Queen.,"Went through 2 Samsung washing machines and 1 Samsung dryer. Been super happy with these machines so far.

I’m just a rando on the internet but I have a speed queen tr5 washer that has broken twice in 6 months. It will wash but then not do the final spin. The lights blink 4 times. I need to unplug the machine, plug back in, and then use “spin only” mode. I’ve had a technician come and tell me it’s because the tub is off center. He fixed it and then 2 months later it started doing the same thing. I got speed queen based on all the great reviews, but that tr5 has been bad luck for me.

I can't tell the difference between them, I've had zero problems with either. Gold is the “gold standard” treatment for a full coverage crown. It can withstand occlusal forces better than any other material. Other “white” crown materials like zirconias and porcelains are for esthetics. It’s always a treat when a patient comes in with a well made gold crown. It’s a shame you don’t see them as much anymore I recently went to the dentist and found out some old silver fillings were “worn out” and had to be replaced. I was told most dental work today uses tooth colored resin (plastic) for cosmetic reasons and ease of installation. When I did a little research I found out they are not very durable. I asked the dentist about gold and he said it would cost about three times as much but he has seen gold fillings that were over 50 years old and looked like they were done yesterday.

Another Item that made my life easier is a dyson hair dryer. I dont think its a for life thing as I am not sure the quality will live up to it. But ill have it at least for a good time.

"The Zippo lighter. A true Buy It For Life item that you can still buy today. This one is only about 5 years old, but you send any Zippo lighter from any time period to the factory, and they’ll send it back working like a new one. Oh, and still 🇺🇸MADE IN USA🇺🇸","14 on the bottom is the manufacturing year.  As a Zippo collector myself, id like to give a bit of advice to anyone looking at better using their Zippo.

* When you buy it, even brand new, open it, take the cotton out and replace it with tampon cotton. It's much more absorbent and makes the lighter last longer.
* If your wick is really worn out, either pull it and snip it, or turn it around and use the other end. No need to replace just yet. Just make sure that the tip of the wick stays just under the rim of the head.
* Just as the Rolex, who has a unique sound \(if it's an original\) so does the Zippo have a unique sound when you open it. If opening slowly, you should hear a scratch\-like sound, as if sharpening a blade with a whetstone, followed by a sharp fling. If you have a Zippo, go ahead, put it next to your ear and listen.
* Zippo still honours their already include lifetime warranty. They have headquarters in a lot of countries so if you're outside the US, check your countries Zippo website and find out where to send it for free repairs and return.
* The best selling Zippo design today, besides the plain simple models or the Jack Daniels \(and other brands logo's\) is the \[Zippo Spectrum 151\]\([https://www.blademaster.co.nz/ic/3869731062/151.1.jpg](https://www.blademaster.co.nz/ic/3869731062/151.1.jpg)\), also known as Chameleon or Gasoline.
* Zippo's changed in size alot during the years, starting as very big and bulky lighters, going down to today's size and starting their ""ladies"" slim line in 1956 which didn't got very popular with both sexes very quickly.

Zippo started in 32 but made the first lighter in 1933. Their original logo was just plain letters Zippo, no stylistic font, this was until 1954 when they changed to the Zorro like Z. In 1958 they finally implemented a code system on the bottom of the lighters which would then make it easier to identify when it was manufactured, namely the dots. It was year based only and followed the format of ""4 4, 4 3, 3 3, 3 2, 2 2, 2 1, 1 1, 1 "". Starting with dots, followed by straight lines, the forward slashes and then backslashes. Before finishing the forward slashes however, in 1980, they changed their logo again to the one we know today, Z linking to the i and the flame for the dot. 

Here it gets a bit interesting, Midway in 1986, they swapped the first half of their backslashes with letters for months instead, and the other half was turned back to straight lines. This happened in July, which is why the earliest letter Zippo will be G II. This went on with A to L letters for months and roman numbers for years until 2000 when they switched to today's standard of Arabic numbers. But it for life. Fill it daily."
Congresswoman Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) introduces bill to require labeling of home appliance lifespans. What do you think of this?,"Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) introduced the Performance Life Disclosure Act. The legislation will require home appliance manufacturers to label products with the anticipated performance life with and without recommended maintenance, as well as the cost of such maintenance.

The legislation will help consumers make better-informed purchasing decisions based on the expected longevity of home appliances and avoid unexpected household expenses. Manufacturers would be incentivized to produce more durable and easily repairable products.

Despite advances in appliance technology in the past few decades, appliances are becoming less reliable and more difficult and expensive to repair. As a result, families are spending more money on appliances and replacing them more often.

Under the bill, the National Institute of Standards and Technology would determine which home appliances fall under the requirement, and manufacturers would have five years to comply.

More on her Instagram page here: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DC18jcDpnMS/?igsh= What happens if the manufacturer says the expected lifespan is 10 years and it breaks in 5? [deleted] I think they do something like this in Australia and I have heard some folks from there say good things about it. Yes I know it is hard to quantify and people use things different, BUT there are key areas like how long will they supply parts or updates?

That 70's Plant,"Here's a different type of buy-it-for-life product. My grandmother bought this plant for me on the day I was born in the (ahem) ""late"" 1970's. So you can see that it is approximately 40 years old, and still flourishing! While I was growing up, my mother always took care of this plant, with an occasional comment that ""you remember that this is your plant?"". My grandmother is now long since deceased, and my mother passed away about 5 years ago from cancer, so this plant lives on as a memory of both of them. I'm going to do my best to see that it outlives my life and can be handed down to my kids. How's that for BIFL?

[Edit] This is a pothos plant.
[Edit #2] Almost forgot to mention something fun about this particular plant. After paying little attention to this plant until I moved out on my own, I took it to my new house and re-potted it. When I did that, I found buried in the leaves a little plastic sign that says ""It's a Boy!"". If you zoom in on the picture here, you can see it in blue, between the leaves. In India we call this the money plant. There is a superstition that if you steal a clipping of this plant from a rich household the richness will follow you as well. You can't ask for it you have to steal a clipping. :) I bougt a plant almost 10 years ago when I got sober. Almost threw it away the other day. This has convinced me to hold on to it."
This securifort safe has prevented three break ins at work.,"More details for those curious:

  In the last five years, burglars have attempted to steal the contents of this safe, which contains about 50 000 dollars worth of cellphones. The first time, they tried to use a grinder on the front as pictured. Second time they pried the quarter inch steel off the back and once again took a grinder to the back. However, under the steel is concrete reinforced with rebar, stones and ""chicken wire"".

  The third time, which happened this weekend, they once again tried with an angle grinder to the front.

  Alas, no avail.

  I must note these events have all taken place over the course of about 5 years. In the pub where I used to work my boss misplaced the keys whilst tidying his office (he threw them in the bin but never admitted it) the safe had all the staffs wages inside from the previous month, which we were all looking forward to. 

We called the company who fitted the safe and they came around to have a look. There was no spare keys (obviously) so the technician set about trying to drill the lock. Now imagine a person with a mains powered hammer drill attempting to drill through solid metal in a small room directly attached the side of a very fancy pub restaurant, not a peaceful atmosphere. 

Eventually he gave up and showed me he had only got about 3/4 of an inch into the metal and was concerned about dead locking the safe if he continued in that manner. So he called in the big guns (being 2 guys who I assume were pro safe crackers but on the surface, looked homeless) they carted the safe out into the car park and set about cutting through the bottom of it. They started by drilling holes in the shape of a square then cutting the remaining metal with an angle grinder, then they whacked the shit out of the cement with a pick, then cut again with the grinder for a few hours before finally repeating the same square drill technique on the inner skin of the safe. They called me over to witness the entry and I happily collect the (now stinking dirty) wages! 

In total it took the guys nearly 5 hours to get in there so I'm not surprised your safe hasn't been broken just yet.  Give me an hour with an angle grinder and I’ll impregnate the bitch!"

"Graphgear 500 mechanical pencil. The one on top I’ve used for 20 years, the other is brand new.","The best part is everyone loses that dang clip on the end. Problem with pens/pencils is I tend to lose them way before they have a chance to break or wear out.

Microwaves have a wavelength of 1 millimeter to 1 meter peak-to-peak. For reference, visible light is 380-780 nanometers(.000001 of a mm) and x-rays have a wavelength of 10 to .01 nanometers.

These things don’t quit.) They sew nicer straight stitches than multi-thousand-dollar plastic machines and can be easily found for cheap.

PSA: Buying For Life means taking care of your stuff,"I’ve never seen anyone mention this on this sub, but I think it’s the most important part of BIFL. If you’re going to buy something and especially if you’re going to spend a lot of money on it, take care of it! 

Don’t leave your nice clothes on the ground where they’re going to get stepped on or snagged, don’t leave nice products in the car, don’t leave things where they might get spilled on or dirty or damaged period. 

Put your stuff where it’s supposed to go so that it will last longer. Hang up your clothes at the end of the day, keep your things organized and out of harm’s way. Doing this will make even cheap things have a longer life span and perform better during that time. ✌️ also, preventive maintenance / repair items, rather than letting them get run down to an irreparable state. This applies to literally everything in life and not just products we buy. Our bodies, our relationships, our jobs, etc, all REQUIRE maintenance.  I'm glad you posted this.

A good part of leveling up your maintenance skills are to fix things yourself too.  Learn it. Live it.  Break it.  Then fix. These skills, to me, can make even a cheap ""throwaway"" item last 10x longer than most people get.

The moment I see a proclamation that something is ""maintenance free"" I avoid it instantly. This way, it’s sometimes possible to make “cheap” things last for ages!"

The rubber doesn't hold up to daily wear, but they do last for a long, long time. I'm currently on my second pair, I should be good for another decade at least. The biggest worry is that the rubber/synthetics start to deteriorate after a period of time.   But leather products can look brand new decades after they were made if they were stored properly.   And since winter boots are likely not used as much as other shoes they can last a really long time.    Just to show what it can look like here is a pair of boots I just bought.   They are new old stock and had never been used.   They look like they just came out of a factory but they were made in 1973.

"To avoid counterfeits and get real BIFL products, don't shop Amazon","tl;dr - Don't shop Amazon if you want to really be sure to get non-counterfeit BIFL product.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~In a recent thread on Darn Tough socks, the question came up whether you could buy from Authorized Sellers via Amazon to make sure you get legit (non-counterfeit) product.

/u/ThanatonautXP asked ""Doesn't all the inventory get mixed together at Amazon...?"" and I wrote a long response that feels like it needs it own post for the good of the BIFL community. It comes up regularly for Darn Tough, but the same thing applies for...a lot of different product.

The answer to that question: It depends. But probably yes.

Amazon assumes that all product is genuine, and that all sellers of a product are providing legit product (intentionally remaining ignorant that counterfeit product exists). So if there are 5 sellers of Darn Tough socks (we'll call them Seller A/B/C/D & DT), Amazon tosses all that product together in the same bin at their warehouse.

So if Seller C has some counterfeit socks, they can provide them to Amazon to sell and they'll get mixed in with the legit stuff. And there's a lot of competition to ""win the buy box"" (ie ""be the Seller that is listed by default for a given product when a consumer goes to buy"") based on the price you list your product at (and a couple other things). Seller C can undercut A/B/D and DT by a few pennies and be the ""Seller"" when you search for Darn Tough socks. And even though 100% of the socks they provided to Amazon are counterfeit, they have about an 80% (1 in 5) chance of having legit product delivered to the customer.

Meanwhile, if you're a conscientious customer and really want to be sure that you're getting the genuine thing, you can switch sellers and specifically select DT for a few pennies more. Great! Except you have the same 80% chance of getting legit product, and 20% chance of being ripped off. (And that's what we see over and over again in the BIFL community.)

This is BS and Amazon knows it, except...any of those Sellers can *pay extra* to Amazon for the privilege of getting their product binned on its own (hmmm...wonder why Amazon remains ignorant of the counterfeit issue?). But Amazon **does not give customers any way of knowing** whether the product they're trying to buy is binned separately or not. PLUS, Amazon demands that their Sellers give them enough inventory to fill the bins at every region/warehouse/location so Prime shoppers can get their product in 2 days. If they don't give enough inventory to Amazon, Amazon can just decide to...not offer product from DT for a given region/warehouse/location, and all sales of that product will come from Seller A/B/C/D who let their product be binned together.

So DT can *pay extra* for the privilege of getting their product binned separately. And *pay extra* to fill all those bins with extra inventory. In hopes that customers shopping will choose to make a few extra clicks and spend a few pennies extra for legit product.

In most cases, ignorant customers won't make the extra clicks, and will always choose the cheaper option. So DT would be spending more....only to find themselves still not selling as much volume. So they just say 'Fsck it' and let their product be binned with counterfeit product. Because that's the only way they don't kill their sales volume or their margin (or both!)

And they feel like they have no choice. Because if you want to be on eCommerce, you have to be on Amazon. And making money on Amazon means you have to put up with Amazon's BS and exploitative policies.

So, fellow BIFL'ers--if you want to be sure you are getting legitimate, non-counterfeit product, use Amazon to find a brand you like, and then go to that brand's own webpage to buy it (or find out where it is sold locally). Amazon really can't be trusted to deliver non-counterfeit product anymore.

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger. You're my first!  To the person who reported this as misinformation, can you please explain why here? So basically, buy from the original (in this case Darn Tough) website instead of Amazon Amazon is just becoming US AliExpress."

Watch purchased from LRF Antique Watches on eBay.


*Edit: After rereading the original eBay description, I'd like to apologize for claiming the originality of the parts of this watch. Nowhere does Stan Czubernat claim that it's all original. He stated that the crown is the original factory crown. The movement is serialized - made in 1916, and the case and caseback are serialized - made in 1917. The crystal guard is also serialized, but there isn't enough info available to determine when it was made. As u/Devillecturbon mentioned, not every part of the movement is serialized, so parts could have been replaced long ago. Stan installed a new mainspring, crystal, and crown tube inner sleeve. He did not polish the case. I've deleted my second comment claiming the rest of the components' originality. Sorry for the fuck up on my part u/Devillecturbon*"

WalMart had a meeting with Snapper and asked them to make a cheaper, ""budget"" version for their stores. The CEO of Snapper refused even though it kept them out of a massive market.

Things have changed since then but older Snapper lawnmowers were built like tanks. We had two of them while I was growing up ... the first one worked fine but we replaced it with a bigger model when we got a house with a larger lawn.

Unfortunately not possible to get the entire collection in one photo but this corner of the kitchen holds a good chunk of it.

Everything except the pressure canner was bought second-hand and it all sees regular use. I’m astounded at the strength of the rack holding up all of that iron! Nice collection! This should be an ad for metro racks I swear, those All Americans are impossible to find second hand. You either get one as an heirloom, and don't have to look, or you buy new.

I analyzed the 25 most recommended vacuum cleaners on reddit,"Interesting stats. I guess I still ended up with Miele after seeing numerous vac-techs on here shouting out that brand. That probably was the biggest deciding factor, and so far it's turned out to be a good call. Any chance that influenced any of the data? This is definitely one of those situations where popularity does not translate into quality.  Dyson has a huge marketing machine and is a popular brand, despite having quality issues compared to similarly priced rivals.    

McDonalds is probably the most ""popular"" restaurant in America... but most would acknowledge that this does not translate to quality. Who the hell is spending $1400 on a vacuum?"

My old car toy [Sachs] survived 7 kids and still rolling after 35 years...,"I want an adult sized one.  Back when things were made with metal  I lived on a hill and got those pedals turning so fast with momentum that they would leave nasty bruises on your ankles if you tried to match its speed. Then there is also the times my friends and I would try to navigate a 90 degree turn into my parent's driveway which usually resulted in rolling the cart with the kid being ejected into the far side lawn. For more fun, a friend would shove himself over the front axle between the two steering support frames. The pull brake would be useless with that much weight and speed, and the only way to slow down was to Scandinavian flick the cart into a barrel role."
My 30 year old kitchen stove that is still used daily,"This looks more like a commercial stove than a residential one.  If it is, that would explain its durability.  Commercial stuff is usually built tougher cause it gets treated rougher and used more hours per day. I fix Subzero/Wolf products. This the ""old"" Wolf, back when it was a commercial brand. The new Wolf isn't like this anymore. It's surprising to find commercial products in a residential home. They don't meet the legal requirements for insulation.

"My bike just turned 28 years young. I still ride it to work every day, rain or shine","One of three things will happen with this bike:

1) I will pass it down to my nephew when he needs an old bike to do stuff with and I’m too old to bike. He will pass it down to his son.

2) it will eventually fall into the canal or eaten by a street sweeper 

3) it’ll just be stolen one day.

Such is the way of bikes in the Netherlands [deleted] This is a really comfortably set up commuter bike. Rain guards. Step-over frame. Cushioned, sprung seat. And swept back handlebars. The wraparound chain guard and built in rear bike lock are so damn civilized I nearly spilled my tea.

Looking at the American bike market, we have a lot of silly perceptions. People sometimes go for mountain bikes over a bike like this one, because it “looks girly.” 

The step-over frame of course is irrevocably associated with “women’s bike” but this is a manufactured association and really dumb. *Everyone* benefits from being able to stand at a stoplight without a bar in their crotch.

And too many seats are streamlined and slimmed down because it makes them look like racing saddles, where weight is of prime concern. Only women are shameless about wanting a big cushioned seat because they don’t care about looking like racers. But this again is dumb because a comfortable seat is great for everyone. 

Apart from all that I think few people know the joy of this kind of handlebar. How comfortable it is on your hands and how it allows you to sit upright. Straight-pipe mountain bike handlebars = yuck. 

Anyway I just wanted to say that as a man I would ride the hell out of this bike and even from a distance I can tell it’s a beaut."

"Still sporting my dad's Coleman Classic tent from 70's. No leaks, and doesn't require a rain fly. All original poles in tact after 44 years.","I can smell it. That's because that's a Springbar Tent! I didn't know they licensed to Coleman, but I just read up on it.

Springbar is a Utah company that's been making these tents since 1957. My dad has one that we grew up camping in. He bought it in 1963, and it's still perfectly usable to this day.

I have a 10x12 Springbar that I was lucky enough to score off some classifieds for $200. It was made in 1982, and is still perfect.

Check out Springbar online if you want the epitome of ""Buy It  For Life""

They're spendy when bought new. But if you take care of it, your kids will be passing it down to your grandkids. They're awesome tents. It just weighs 50 lbs."
This sub should be called “old stuff that still works”,"I came to this sub because I thought it was a sub for sharing and discussing purchases that will last a lifetime, make for a good investment, encourage frugality and limit waste.

Instead, it’s filled mostly with things that either don’t exist anymore, can’t be purchased anymore, or are expensive antique (borderline novelty) pieces. This comes up a lot. I think a lot of people, like me, want a sub that goes into detail \*why\* something is BIFL -- and not just a photo of something that has happened to survive. 

It's not like I'm posting this sort of content, but I'd love to see styles of stitching that are superior, what makes one thermos better than the other, what to look for in a new toaster.. etc. Not just a 'buy this brand', but 'when you're in the market, look for these characteristics' 

All this being said, there may be a low signal to noise ratio, but that signal content is pretty fucking great. Time to sort by new and be the change you want to see in the world by downvoting everything I follow this sub for the rare moments that they suggest a decent company that is proven to honor their life time warranty agreements or provide replacements or support for worn out/old products.

But most of this sub is just ""I found this in my great grandfather's attic and it still works despite not being used for years and years."""

Pepe has been faithfully riding the roll at my parents house for over 22 years. (Crosspost from /r/funny),"It's good to know that out of all the tiny, mustachioed, pink-hatted unicycle-riding toilet paper dispenser toys, this one is, by far, the most durable.   Imagine all the poop molecules that thing must have. Makes me want to build something similar with one of those rolling measuring tapes.  Be interesting to see how many feet (miles?) of TP would get used in my house of 4 women (wife and 3 daughters) in a year!"
Managed to score an Yrjö Kukkapuro Office chair from the 70s,"Wonder how many farts were shot into this thing. So I needed a new office chair, but I didn't want to buy some sub par crap for too much money from Ikea or something. I did consider a Herman Miller, but they're pretty expensive and I don't really like how they look.

So I started looking for office chairs online and stumbled upon this Kukkapuro Plaano Chair. Which I didn't know anything about because I'm an American in Finland, I was just getting some Bond villain vibes, it looked well made and I wanted it. 

So I meet this guy and pay like 50 bucks for it, then I properly look it up and realize these sell new for like 1400 euros.

They're made from laminated birch and aluminum, pretty damn heavy and has phenomenal support on the lower back. The head rest is actually an entirely separate piece of wood and cushion, so I can remove it and turn it into a ""mid height "" office chair if I don't want the head support.

 I had to redo one of the cushions, I added a patch under a portion of it just in case it started to wear and I oiled it with boiled linseed oil. I'll replace the wheels if I can find some stemless caster wheels. Apparently these are ridiculously hard for me to find in Finland. Everyone makes caster wheels that just ""snap"" into an office chair, but these appear to have metal stems that are non removable, the plastic wheels just pop off. Other than that, the whole thing is pretty awesome and works great!

Edit: I get it, my grammar sucks.

Edit: additional photos of the back and without the headrest

http://imgur.com/a/182aaLf I feel like your command of time travel is probably more valuable than the chair that your brought back."
L.L. Bean will not re-sole your boots (a paid service) unless you can prove you are the original owner!,"I called L.L. Bean to arrange shipping of my Bean boots to them for a re sole. This is a paid service and I assumed open to anyone willing to pay for it. I was told I would need proof of purchase to qualify for this service.  I bought them in like new condition on eBay years ago and have finally worn through the sole. She even told me their policy was to prevent people from re-soling ""goodwill and flea market boots"". But that seems insane to me since it's a paid service that ONLY they can provide! I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 

Side note, I went to return a poor fitting jacket within their return window and they did a full court press guilt trip. I have been a loyal customer for decades, but after these two recent interactions L.L. Bean is dead to me.

Edit: to all you saying ""Go to a cobbler"", these aren't that kind of boots. These are the classic Maine Hunting Shoe and the entire lower has to be replaced at the factory with a new one. You can't just glue a vibram sole on. 

Also, people are conflating this situation with people abusing the return policy. This isn't a return or an exchange.  The way I see it, this is like the Toyota dealer refusing to service my Corolla because I bought it at carmax. Absolutely bats**t crazy anti customer policy. I wonder if it's possible that L L Bean re-soles the shoes at breakeven or even at a slight loss as a ""service"" to their customers. They're bailing out of the lifetime warranty thing completely, and no doubt view existing lifetime warranties as nothing more than a liability to avoid.

[New version is one year only](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/513705)

[Announced](https://www.mensjournal.com/gear/l-l-bean-changes-lifetime-guarantee-to-one-year-return-policy/) in [2018](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/02/09/bean-dropping-its-unlimited-returns-policy/LEc2iLzayaJxxFDkz0or8K/story.html)

IMO, the sensible thing for them to do would be to fix pricing on the re-soling service instead of trying to use a discounted price as sales incentive. How many people are really deciding between re-soling use boots versus buying new boots? I'd expect that percentage to be way higher in this subreddit, BTW, and I'd expect that people here would simply compare the costs of having it resoled by a dedicated cobbler or having it resoled by a manufacturer and select both brand and service accordingly. I interned for them nearly a decade ago (2011 and 2012) and I remember doing a tour and them showing us the “closet cleaners” of people just returning garbage bags of what they never used. They were saying it was getting bad then. And they had a whole section of the warehouse dedicated to it. They ruined it for everyone. But they would put what they couldn’t restock in an employee store. I got so many boat shoes for $7. 

Side note, their tote manufacturing and re-soleing process is really cool."

Alarm clock lasted over two decades and somehow knows when daylight savings is still,"For my 7th birthday I asked my mom for a wallet, watch, and alarm clock.

I got one of these FREE from a former co-worker whose father had two, and didn't need an extra. I am so grateful, and glad that it's a quality model. Even better, I found a set of lids that fit the bowls a couple years ago, so I'm all set."
My mom’s joint roller from 1969,"You are mistaken, Sir.   The signs clearly stated: “for tobacco use only.” I learned it from watching you, mom. I learned it from watching you!

I thought I would be cheeky and use one of those, but my dad is old school. He rolled it in one hand by putting the paper in his palm and sprinkling some bud on it and just rolling his fingers from the palm up as far his fingers as they would go. Fucker rolled a perfect doobie and I was barely putting the paper in the machine."
"This sub is slowly becoming ""Buy Overpriced Luxury Goods"" rather than ""Buy It For Life.""","[deleted] People are using (or want) BIFL to be ""things that last a lot longer than other things like them"", e.g. BIFL boots last 20 years instead of 2.  BIFL is the new ""tried, tested and true"".

Like others ITT say, the subreddit gets boring if you limit BIFL to the cast iron pans and Coleman lanterns that your grandpa used, especially if the company is gone or the thing is manufactured in a much cheaper factory with lower quality bits nowadays.

Rule 7 says ""This is a subreddit emphasizing products that are made to last. Users are encouraged to submit products that are well made and durable even if they won't last you an entire lifetime.""

In the end, for the time being this is still a subreddit where you can find durable, long-lasting high-quality stuff thanks to redditors willing to speak up and call out the ridiculous while still keeping it respectful and being considerate and open-minded of opinions that don't quite line up with their own.

If you want the subreddit to stay strong, maybe all we need is a bit more engagement.  Question non-BIFL posts.  Be respectful and open-minded.  Be patient with newbies and explain your positions reasonably.  Care. Its pretty easy for that to happen in this sub i feel. You cant expect something intended to last forever/a long time to be very cheap. At the same time, pricey items aren't all great."
Today I realised that consumables CAN be BIFL. 7kg of wrapping paper.,"My father was head of maintenance at a shopping mall. One of the seasonal stores wrapped presents for you. It eventually went out of business and Dad brought home 4 half reams of wrapping paper when it did. This was when I was like 8 years old. I'm 28 now and we still have all 4 rolls.

Edit: [For those interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/5jwo8a/in_response_to_other_wrapping_paper_related_posts/) When I was very young, maybe 2? My parents scored a giant roll of glossy orange paper, I'm sure it was very cheap/free. Every present for every occasion for the next 10 years was wrapped in orange paper. It was bittersweet when it finally ran out. Like Costco aluminium foil... pretty sure my son will inherit it. Lol"

My Grandfather's Snap-on wrench set made in 1957,"[deleted] Good shit! If any wear down from use you can literally swap them for brand new ones! I used to have a deep aversion to Snap-On because of their price, but having watched buddies walk onto the truck with a worn out tool and back off with a brand new one without taking out their wallet speaks to me as I get older and my tools do as well. My dad is a life long mechanic, he loves Snap On tools. He bought a hammer in the 80s he used every day at work, hell I even used it when I was a kid. This hammer held up well, sure it looked old, but it was sturdy and reliable. A few years ago a Snap On truck visited my dad's work and of course he went to look for something cool to buy. The guy noticed his old hammer and offered to replace it for free. My dad, a very sentimental guy, refused because of all the memories he had with it. The guy told him to just keep it and gave him a brand new one anyways. This company, although expensive, embodies the type of customer service I feel is lacking these days by showing the customers that have been with you the longest just as much support as a new potential customer."
Best Vacuum for Pet Hair (IMO),"I finally found a vacuum that works extremely well for cleaning up after pets so I thought I would share my experience. I’ve got two long haired cats, 1300 sq ft of space (mostly carpet), and the Sebo E3 has been a total lifesaver. 

The suction is incredibly strong—cat litter actually gets sucked up instead of just shot around the floor like with my old vacuums. And when it comes to fur on furniture, one pass and it’s gone. No need to keep going over the same spot.

The brush roller pops out super easily (no tools needed), which makes cleaning it way less of a chore. I also really appreciate that the attachments store tightly on the vacuum itself—they don’t fall off mid-clean like on a lot of others I’ve tried.

One of the biggest selling points for me was the 10-year warranty (if you buy from a Sebo authorized dealer). It’s such a solid, well-built machine, and I love that I won’t need to replace it constantly. I’ve bought 4 vacuums in the last 6 years because they break and cost more to get fixed than buying a new one. None of them ever worked as well as this one does even when they were brand new. 

The vacuum bag compartment is fully sealed and hospital-grade filtration. No more dusty, smelly air blowing in my face. This is huge for anyone with allergies.

Highly recommend if you’ve got pets and are tired of fighting fur and litter every day. 

I don’t have a Sebo dealer near me so I ordered it from a dealer I found on the Sebo dealer locator that has a website and ships (Geek Vacuums). I have no affiliation with Sebo or this dealer. They were extremely helpful so I figured it’s worth mentioning for anyone who doesn’t have a Sebo dealer near them). They had a 15% off promo and threw in a free box of bags plus a little tool that slices hair off the brush roller in one swipe. Seriously satisfying.

Highly recommend if you’ve got pets and are tired of fighting fur and litter every day.  we should link up and try my Miele C1 Cat & Dog against your Sebo E3.  Like a battle of the titans...  short hair, long hair, human hair... etc.

We could charge admission, and make an event of it! Bought a D4 a few weeks ago. Sebo is the real deal. Like it more than the Miele it replaced.  We have a Sebo K3 and 3 cats. It's some of the best money I've ever spent after dealing with bad vacuums forever. 

The air just smells cleaner after running it.

The local dealer also threw in boxes of free bags and a one year checkup."

"Was given this MS Natural Keyboard Pro on Day 1 at my job. 23 years later, I was told that new equipment will be at the new offices.

"IGLOO just released a retro line, claiming to manufacture the coolers with the same material/ machining as they did back in the day. Our family’s OG coolers (~30 years old) have gotten tons of use and been kicked around a lot and are still solid+sturdy as ever.","Dang, I was just in the market for a 2 gallon water cooler and I went with the Stanley. Where I used to work, I was provided a 30y/o Igloo Commercial grade cooler. I loved that thing, but when I looked at a  new one, I could tell it just didn't seem like the same quality. I should have stolen it when I left that job. Its pretty cool that they are making them again. I remember carrying these things onto sports fields all the time growing up. Heavy as hell but its durability makes it portable since they don't flex very much. That's important when they are full and you don't want the top popping off. I wonder what the health effects are of using one plastic container for your entire life though.

Edit: spent 5 minutes looking it up and plastic is pretty safe water storage, just don't keep the same water in there for years on end obviously. But does the spigot leak every single time you use it, like the original?"
Metal razor with reusable steel blades (6 years and running),"My Merkur is almost 20yo and is still in pristine condition 😎 I bought one of those leaf razors, probably op, but really good.  They have a triple razor version I can load with as many as I want, diff needs.  Going on \~4 years strong.

but love not buying those plastic pos op ones!! I bought a stack of razor blades on Amazon in 2006 before this went mainstream again, and I got hundreds of blades for ~$20, still have a bunch of them, sealed."
Tom Brady has been wearing the same shoulder pads since his freshman year at Michigan in 1995. They're older than 5 of his current team-mates.,"Maybe I just don't know a lot about football but wouldn't the pads wear out like a pair of running shoes would? or even the regulations would change phasing his old style out (similar to helmets)? So the pads aree to him, like hair was to Samson? Someone just needs to steal the pads and his magic will disappear. Sidney Crosby has been wearing the same cup since his midget days.  


This is more superstition than ""buy it for life"" though!

Tatami Room bed frame,"After a five month wait, our tatami room bed frame has arrived! This is the King honey oak platform bed (regular height) with Mado headboard. I was really impressed with the quality and sturdiness of the frame, as well as the ease in putting it together. It did truly take longer to unpackage it from all the layers it was packed in (not a bad thing)! I do see this as a buy it for life purchase, so the wait of a few months in the grand scheme of things wasn’t that bad. 

Pictured with Leesa natural hybrid mattress, Quince bedding (mostly).
 As someone who lived in Japan at one point, it took me an embarassing amount of time to realize Tatami is the product name, not what it is - I was thinking ""that's made of wood, where's the tatami mats at?""

That's a beautful bed frame, I'm taking notes for when I want to replace mine... When I was researching bed frames about six months ago, it came down to this frame or the one I ended up getting from Silk & Snow. Pretty much didn't go with the Tatami bc I couldn't find much info on it outside of their website and no really good pictures either. Looking at these I'm kinda wishing I had gone with the Tatami! Looks incredible and seems solid as hell. I like how low it is as well. I've had the same tatami/futon wooden frame since it was given to me back in 1995, given to me second-hand from the previous owners who owned it for 10 years prior to that. 

It lives proudly in my living room as a couch, with the original mattress, but a new mattress cover. I've had to replace 2 slats in the entire 29 years I've owned it. 

It will probably continue going on well after I leave this orbiting rock, passing it down to my next of kin."
23 year old Vtech power pad still going strong!,V-tec just kicked in yo  Got that thing for x-mas one year. Never did that much with it. Only had 2-3 cartridges for it.

What are some household items that you cannot ever go back to not having?,"I got a bidet a few years ago, and its insane how life changing it is for only like 30 bucks on the low end.

I recently got a water flosser and its so far amazing, I know it might not be as good as flossing, but I hated flossing and never did it and probably was doing a bad job with it when I was flossing. But with this I use it twice a day and I look forward to using it.

I'm looking for other stuff like this, items that you would never think to go back from, ideally nothing too crazy expensive hopefully under like $200, unless its really truly amazing.

"A 1967 35mm Minolta AL-F rangefinder. Bought for fun, for about $15. Works surprisingly well. Beautiful colors.","Camera lens has something to do with colours, but film has a much greater influence Where do you buy film these days and where do you get the film developed and prints made? Have to do all that stuff through online stores, or maybe local camera shops? A bit of background: 
I bought this as a test and for fun. I have other digital cameras, but holding the processed photo is a little special. 

This camera has a battery operated light meter that used old mercury cells, but there is modern button cell in it that works just fine. 

I was little worried about the light seals on the film door, but it’s all good. I got 26 pretty sharp, well exposed images out of a 24 shot roll. 

The camera is “shutter priority”, meaning I set the shutter speed on the lens ring, and using the built-in light meter, the camera sets the aperture. You can see the aperture setting in the view finder window along with the scene and the rangefinder focusing patch. A second ring on the lens focuses the shot."
Why LL Bean's Boots Keep Selling Out: they refuse to outsource labor and continue to sew them by hand.,"This trend is the funniest thing to me.

I saw you guys appreciated the 1960s stove so I thought you might like mine,"What is this, from the 1860’s? This is r/stoveporn if I’ve ever seen it. Glorious good redditor, exquisitely glorious.

I would highly recommend the 2002 Ford Ranger,"I had a 1993 ford ranger with a 4cylinder. I bought it for $1500 on eBay in 2010 and sold it for $1600 on eBay in 2018. It was glorious and would not die. Mines a 2000. Breaks down every 4-6 months and costs between 4-600 to fix. So long as you live outside the salt belt, I agree. They have terrible corrosion issues (frame, bed, body - everything but the hood, really)."

My Grandfather’s. My Dad’s. And now mine. Still going strong.,"Right tire looks a little low there son. I'd be willing to bet that machine has another couple generations in it too. Grandpa had an older Massey (84 model, definetly not this old) and it was a tough old girl for how much he used it.  Those were certainly some badass tractors.  It had upgraded hydraulics but it's what I used to learn to drive.  Bought it knew and ran in almost daily in the evenings until 2012 when he traded it in on a New Holland that was bigger and a front end loader.  I love the New Holland, but I missed that old Massey.  Wish he never traded it.  For the size, it was so much easier to manuever than that New Holland, especially for what he probably got out of the Massey in a trade.

Thing was pristine too.  Grandpa came from the Depression, so EVERYTHING was taken care of.  Waxed the thing twice a year, other than scratches and odds and ends, it was just a little faded.  Had an orange 70s Allis Chalmers lawn mower he literally ran the wheels off almost, and is in still damn good shape."

So excited - just received our Christmas gift from my parents!,"Wool is amazing if you sweat at night. I have a wool mattress protector and a wool comforter and I have stopped waking up at night from being sweaty.

I was lucky enough to score a queen size Glacier National Park Pendleton for $10 at a thrift store recently after wanting one forever, but not being able to commit to the price tag. I was freaking out for a good two weeks about it. It remains my best thrift find yet and I’ll have it forever. 

It’s clear they put a lot of thought and care into getting you this as a gift. Enjoy it forever!"
Got this new for my 13th birthday. I’m 32.,"I still got my AIWA stereo that looks very similar to this in my garage.  I got it in high school and I'm 38. True BIFL. This is the Phillips FWC550 or some variant of it. I know because I also owned one of these pre-Bluetooth behemoths of sound and it lasted forever. Made it through high school, college parties, and years after with the use of an AUX cord. It doubled as a decent surround sound system for movies during that time, as well. So many good memories with this thing, and it absolutely delights me to see someone else in the world may equally know that same exact feeling. 

In the middle of being socially distanced from nearly everyone, this weird, random thread of humanity pulls me uniquely closer to someone I’ve never met.

I was waiting under an overpass one night at a light to turn on to the freeway when a semi jack knifed above me and launched it's payload of industrial scaffolding off it's bed and on to the roof of my car.  Metal poles skewered through the doors, the front got chopped off by a massive piece of sheet metal, but that tiny ass car took roughly 10,000lbs of construction crap and the roof fucking held.  I walked away from it with bruising, a sore shoulder and a few cuts.  I freaking love those cars. 23K miles a year?! I don't even drive half of that.

The only thing that survived my great grandma’s house fire in the 1920’s is still used regularly in my parents’ kitchen.,"Wait so I’m supposed to use a house fire to season my cast iron? They weren’t kidding when they said good cast iron was expensive The extreme heat made the handle snap off, which my great grandparents had fixed at a welding shop. Otherwise it was in perfect condition. 

It’s a Dixie Foundry Co. #7 cast iron skillet. The company started in 1916 and has since merged with other companies. 

The fire happen in the mid 1920’s, so the pan is at least that old. One day I’ll inherit it and keep on its legacy.

Edit: Nobody was hurt in the fire because my great grandparents were away visiting family in a nearby town. 

Edit 2: typo in the skillet’s name (#7, not 7”)

Edit 3: my grandma (96 and still sharp!) told me the fire was in 1936 when she was 12, not in the 20s. We don’t know when they got the skillet. Love that they braised the handle back together and kept using it."

Got tired of all the mis-matched and bent hangers. Replaced with some heavy duty DODCO Inc. Hangers,These hangers are the exact kind used by Walt Disney world theme parks for hanging costume pieces. They can withstand quite a beating. I’ve seen them hold over 40 pounds. They also come in silver. Was a ruler involved in the making of this post? Be honest.

My 1983 Toyota Land Cruiser hit a big milestone last month,"Congrats on almost having your Cruiser broken in! My mom's 2003 Elantra died, so I bought her a 2002 Echo that had over 400,000 km on it. Mostly highway, but still. Paid $700 for it in 2017. It burned through oil pretty fast, but every mechanic who looked at it said it would make it over 500,000 without breaking a sweat.

Just sold it last week for $500. Wait, a 1983 Cruiser with only 300,000 miles?  That's only 8,100 miles a year!  Do you even Toyota bro?

My cousin's got a 2011 Toyota Sienna that he bought for his business.  He's put about 320,000 miles in just 9 years.  I had to help him move some stuff a few months ago and I got into the vehicle and the damn thing was clean and well maintained.  I looked at the odometer and thought it was a mistake.  I asked him what he does for maintenance.  Since he doesn't know jack shit about vehicles, he just takes it into the Toyota dealership whenever a service light comes on for oil, brakes, what have you and they fix him up.  These vehicles have built-in service reminders that come on for everything, which makes it easy for dumb people.  So he gets an oil change every 5,000 miles, and since he takes it into the dealer, they do any other required maintenance while he is there, like changing air filters, cabin filters, hoses, etc.

With the way that vehicle is wearing, he'll easily drive it past 500,000 miles. Even the paint and trim looks good still."

Why is planned obsolescence still legal?,"It’s infuriating how companies deliberately make products that break down or become unusable after a few years. Phones, appliances, even cars, they’re all designed to force you to upgrade. It’s wasteful, it’s bad for the environment, and it screws over customers. When will this nonsense stop? Planned obsolescence is prohibitively murky to tackle. Deliberate unrepairability, on the other hand, is much easier. You actively deny people the ability to purchase replacement parts, or design it so only you can fix things? Naughty box you go. Because it is extremely difficult to prove.

Also, because a lot of people don't seem to understand that some things have to have a finite lifespan by definition. You can't compare a cast iron skillet to a computer. [deleted]"

It's far from perfect and comes with limitations:

* Outdated information: I'll try to improve this by factoring in recency and some additional product information like prices, specs, etc, that I'm collecting. I also want to add some more statistical significance to the results e.g. by feeding in the amount of recommendations of a product over time.
* Hallucination: As always with these bots, they are sometimes making things up. More training data should help here.
* Performance: Generating the answers is pretty slow and I'll look into improving this.

Take it with a grain of salt and look at it as a fun experiment :) Would love to hear your feedback! Feel like the entirety of reddit could be replaced by ChatGPT-like bots. Reddit is pretty much just repeating questions that has been asked a few thousands times before.

WWII hand-crank flashlight,"This one was issued to my husband's uncle while serving in N Europe. He said they were great--except that the Germans would hear them and send in the mortars.

They were also called ""Dyno Torches,"" which is great, sci-fi, Flash-Gordon-y name, imho. 

Looks like you can pick them up on ebay for around $50 (with the lens, which mine is missing), if you like the history and/or styling. I personally think it's pretty cool that something made in the 1940s and went through combat still works. ymmv Unfortunately no one makes a hand-powered light of this quality any more.

edit: There are plenty of BILF-grade flashlights and even BILF rechargeable batteries being made today though!  They cost $50-$100 typically and are the most common recommendations over at /r/flashlight Throw a 1w led bulb in there and it should actually be usable!"

"My mom's hair dryer has been used for 42 years and stopped working for the first time. Turns out it was just a faulty cable, so I replaced and it's up again","We had one similar to this, and by the early 1990's it was blowing heat out equivalent to a dog panting on your head. Dang I'm 42 and I stopped working a few years ago. Perhaps I need to check for a faulty cable BIFL hair dryers are pretty impressive, ngl. There’s a high wattage fan and a heating element that would be strong enough to melt the whole thing to pieces in seconds if not for the fan. Those put a lot of stress on the circuitry."

"BuyItForLife isn't all about buying high quality products, it's also about routine maintenance to extend their life so I made a short list.","In our busy lives we often forget about maintenance of our everyday items. They only come to mind when they break but the key to extending the life of our stuff is routine maintenance so I made a list to remind everyone of what needs maintained.

Feel free to add on to this list or correct me if I'm wrong about something!

Note: this is a list based mainly on manufacturer recommendations. You can probably get away with doing a lot of these less often than stated but these are meant to give a good baseline. Use your own discretion.

HOUSE


-Washing Machine filter- clean every 2 months
-use self cleaning option in front loading washers seasonally.

Run a hot cycle once a week especially in front loaders to avoid mold and detergent buildup.

-Dryer lint filter - clean every 1-2 uses (dryer vent going outside needs clearing as needed to prevent buildup)


-Dish Washer- Filter cleaned as needed

-Refrigerator Water Filter - 6 months

-Refrigerator coils- clean every 6 months (this saves on power consumption as it makes the coils more efficient)

-HVAC air filter- 2-3 months depending on animals and occupants

-HVAC inspection- once a year

-Inspect fire extinguisher- monthly (if you don't have one get one, make sure it's rated for A,B, and C fires)

-Water Heater- check pressure release valve every 6 months
Flush once a year
-replace anode rod every 1-5 years (keeps your water heater from rusting

-Gutters- clean as needed depending upon how much tree coverage you have

MISCELLANEOUS

Vacuum Cleaner - filters cleaned once a month
Use utility knive to cut hair/string built up on the agitator as needed

Kitchen knives- hone (maintain) and sharpen (revitalize) kitchen knives as needed. Look up a guide so that you do this correctly.

Cast iron cookware- season annually

Leather furniture - 6-12 months

Leather boots - 1-12 months dependent on usage

Lawn Mower/yard equipment- air filter cleaned once a month (replace once a year) 
Replace oil every 20-50 hours or atleast annually
Drain gas at the end of the season

Gas- any gas stored longer than a month should have a stabilizer added to it to prevent deterioration that can gunk up carbuerators. (I recommend startron)

Rain gear- wash atleast once a year.

Tents, sleeping bags, etc - air out at least once a year. If they get wet while using allow to air out once you're home to avoid moisture causing mildew and mold growth.

Electronics with batteries - if stored for an extended period of time keep batteries outside of the compartment to avoid corrosion and save battery life.

Desktop/laptop- clean air intake every 6 months

Coffee maker/ectric kettle- descaled every 60 days to prevent mineral buildup This is great. You can turn a lot of things into BIFL with the proper care. The difference is how often things need to be cared for. I stretch the life of a lot of my stuff because I take care of them, and care less when things are losing life. Thanks for this! The washing machine has a filter. . . ? . . . 😳 One of my dad’s behaviors that I’d noticed growing up, but never thought about until I got much older, is how well he took care of his things. When I was a teenager, sometimes I’d be harsh on something, like a tool or whatever, and he’d yell at me for being careless and I’d say, “Who cares? We’ll just get a new one.” Cringe.

My dad grew up really poor, so for him, taking extra good care of things meant not being in a situation where he really needed something but didn’t have it... like a decent jacket for the cold or for his car to run well enough to get him to and from work."
"The Lifecycle of Clothing Companies, by Muffy Aldrich","Not the best visual but I completely agree with the message. The question is, how do I catch brands in phases 1-3? I always seem to hear about brands in stage 5. Imagine starting a clothing company because you have a vision for a high quality brand, and then just continuing to stick with it. For some reason, that’s too hard Smartwool arteryx filson comes to mind"

Still use same Old Navy leather belt since 8th grade (1998),"Somehow I’m still using this same leather belt 24 years later that I purchased in 8th grade. I’ve used it extensively over the years, often 5 days a week in an outdoor fieldwork setting. It’s the only leather belt I’ve ever owned! I don’t know if this is a testament to the quality of leather, my care of it, or if it’s simply just more impressive that I’ve had the same belt size for 24 years. I've had the same belt since 10th grade.  23 years.  It's from Structure, which has been Express for Men for like 20 years.

"After 7 months of waiting, my BIFL Ernest Wright scissors finally arrived from across the pond.","Can these be used to cut anything or are they material specific? Whats the price for something like this? Out of curiosity, what prompted you to get such nice scissors? You must do a lot of scissoring. Investing in a nice pair of scissors seems pretty niche."
Buy it for multiple lives. I inherited the family Pennsylvania Tuxedo,"My dad’s woolrich outerwear has kept me warm on many cold days hunting. It’s extremely functional and has endured years of walking through brambles and  brush. The buffalo check plaid is easy for other hunters to see.

Henckels kitchen knives. I hone them daily and sharpen them once a year. I have cooked literally thousands of meals with these since I got them in 1999.,"Beware of some of the “other” Henckel’s knife lines, some (unlike the “Twin” line shown above) are much lower grade stamped stuff.  
  
Much like Kitchenaid and Cuisinart (who have lower grade “Walmart” lines with plastic gears and lower grade materials) I’ve seen other grades at big box stores that weren’t higher quality models. Totally BIFL. I’ve had mine since culinary school in 1999 and they will outlast me. Kitchen items are an area where investing quality pays. I’ve had LeCreuset, All Clad, vita-mix (blender) and Kitchenaid (stand mixer). I had to swallow hard at some of the prices but I’ve had all of these items for over twenty years of heavy use and they’re all still going strong. People should also be aware that henckles also now make shitty Chinese knives that come in a block. The chefs knife has mini serrations in it."
Picked up a maytag commercial grade dryer for $600 at lowes open box with manufacturer warranty. MSRP 1200! No WiFi and annoying buzzer that lets you know when it’s done working?? I’ll take it!,"I'll take annoying buzzer over the 3 minute song they have now!! Note for those doing a burnout to their local Lowes:

While this looks like the much lauded 575 Maytag, it is not.*

*Lowes has a fake 575 line that they sell online and in store.  Its is the 575 with a 576 model number.  The difference is this has a one year warranty vice the 575's 5 year warranty.  Dickbutt move?  Yep.  I mean, its still a great product, but spending the same money on the same product with 20% of the warranty period is not cute. I really wish companies would stop putting WiFi and touch screens on literally everything. I’ll take a physical button and no WiFi any day of the week. Less shit to break and have to fix."

"If there is a Ferrari of the pans, I think this is the closest (Le creuset)","Does anyone have any care tips? Mine is due for a deep clean. I like them. As far as new cast iron, I would love a Butter Pat pan, but would not spend the money. My absolute favourite though is a Griswold I got when I was Goodwill hunting and had to restore.

I have one and consider it the Checker Cab of pans!"
I might have found the Holy Grail at a vintage store,"It's neat, but IMO not $80 neat. It's a shame what thrift stores are charging nowadays I got an old, well respected brand flask (Aladdin maybe) thinking 'ah yeah these babies are indestructible!' It leaks. I think time has undermined the seal. I've sadly had to wave goodbye to it.

Side note - although Thermos has a great reputation, I have a few I bought new and their threading always seems to be off these days. Anyone else?! Or am I unlucky/unable to do simple things like twisting lids. Are these the good ones with the lead paint?"
Bought this in 1995 for my last year in middle school. I’m 43 now and still get use out of it.,"Wait... 1995 was my last year in middle school as well and I’m 38. How many times were you held back?

Jansport is buy it for life. Throw it in the washing machine will come out looking a lot better."
"Started upgrading my kitchen with BIFL quality items. The Le Creuset is the single best thing I've ever used for cooking.

Have both of these items as well, and cannot recommend them enough. Also have two other Le Creuset pieces. Hahahah this is literally the Xmas gift I got my girlfriend!!!

Been shopping around metallurgists and engravers in Houston, trying to get her initials stamped on the Kramer zwilling but nobody will touch the thing."
My 33 year old Moccamaster. Dad got it as a gift back in '84. Even the light in the switch still works.,"We just bought one of these brand new, and it's probably the best coffee maker we've ever had. 

It also looks nearly identical. They haven't changed much on 30 years, apparently. 

Hopefully ours lasts 30+ years as well! I am assuming the coffee still tastes good? My fear would be the heat plate temp regulation.  Coffee pro here. This coffee maker is the best thing you can get for home brewing if you're not doing manual pour-over methods. It's Gold Cup Certified, and just so dang pretty."
My dads 25+ year old estwing hammer vs my new estwing,"I found my Estwing in a parking lot when I was an apprentice, I guess it fell out of someone’s tool bag or truck.

21 years later, it’s still a perfectly fine working manual swing press. Now THIS is the Buy It For Life content I'm wanting. While it's possible they downgraded the metal quality over the years, it certainly looks like the available-now product is identical to the one that has lasted for years. Love it!

Edit: I'm not saying that there are changes, only that a picture isn't enough information to be 100% certain nothing changed. Regardless, a picture like this is a fantastic starting point. Wow

I guess why fix what isn't broken"
A good wool blanket will outlast you. This one is pre-1927. It was used for years in railroad sleeper cars.

"We see many requests for backpacks here, so I analyzed the top 25 backpacks on Reddit (r/onebag)","[deleted] I would argue the type of bags you see on onebag/hiking etc aren’t necessarily going to be BIFL. There will obviously be overlaps as a good quality bag is a good quality bag, but modern hiking/day packs make huge longevity sacrifices to keep their weights low.

Packs made from hard wearing materials simply can’t compete as they can add 50% or more more weight which simply isn’t palatable to the hiking community. This is my favorite kind of data. Thank you."
"The product quality on Amazon continues to get worse, where can you search for quality, made in Europe/North America products?","EDIT:

Wow this thread blew up (and rightly so! it's a big problem). Looks like it hit a nerve as it did for me too. Since posting I've been trying to do my job to help, so I built: https://shopboreal.com. It's a search engine where you can select where the product is made (and where it's sold). There are 7M products. I find the thing I want and then use shopping.google.com to find it elsewhere than amazon. Surprisingly, google shopping is better than the stores own search function. There is a ton of shit I can’t find by searching for it directly on the retailer’s website but I’ll find it on that retailer’s website through google shopping easily. Varusteleka [website here](https://www.varusteleka.com/en) for outdoor and winter gear. A large amount of their items are surplus military. Their merino wool items are made for market and super soft - much softer than Smartwool. I haven't had any durability or allergy issues yet.

Edit: fixed link

Adding a detergent suggestion to wash your wool items. I absolutely love [Unicorn Beyond Clean](https://www.unicornclean.com/shop/unicorn-beyond-clean) detergent. You need the tiniest amount and it rinses quickly and easily. I have an XXL front loader and use 1 1/4 tbsp per load with slightly hard water. Works great mixed 50/50 with Persil - I've stopped pretreating stains on clothes, just checking them before they go in the dryer. The issue isn't necessarily where the products are made, the issue is something called commingled inventory. Basically, Amazon throws all products with the same SKU in the same big bin. 

Let's say your store sells the authentic product and mine sells a counterfeit of that product. When a customer orders that product, it's a tossup whether the counterfeit or authentic product will be sent out. As a result, it's wise to avoid anything on Amazon that could potentially cause a hazard if counterfeit, like cookware, electronics, and the like.

"World's Greatest Pencil Sharpener, circa 1920","[This dinosaur of a pencil sharpener](https://imgur.com/a/piablwQ) currently hangs in my parent's house, the house I grew up. My great-great grandparents built the house and it's been in the family since, so there's plenty of old but high-quality things laying around.

It's hard to tell in the picture from the rusting, but it's a Chicago APSCO pencil sharpener, pretty much identical to [this](https://www.madeinchicagomuseum.com/single-post/2014/6/1/Giant-Pencil-Sharpener-by-APSCO-1924). The site says it's from the 1920s, and from what I remember from my childhood you used to be able to make out the make year on the top, and as I recall it was sometime in the 1920s. That means it was probably my great-grandfather who put it up there when it was shiny and new.

This thing can take a brand new unsharpened pencil and have it perfect in two cranks, it's insane. Hands down the most effective pencil sharpener, mechanical or electric, I've ever come across. Thanks Great-Grandpa Joe for buying it for life! I can honestly say that these pencil sharpeners have made quite an impact on my life growing up. There are so many different grinds that you can achieve with all of the bodies being so similarly shaped. 

When electric sharpeners came around in the early 2000s in my classes, I was genuinely distraught. The *""kuhkuhkuhkuh...kuhkuhkuh""* noise was replaced by *""shweeeeeeeeeeeee""* of the electric ones. The little mental break I would have to myself was gone. Yeah, make the argument that I was still doing the act of pencil sharpening however the process was all too different.

It's like when in The Office, Sabre is phasing out the little paper cups in-favor of something more sustainable. Michael complains that he will lose his ""managing by walking around"" style he prefers. I would say this is a very similar circumstance and I felt similarly.

There were times of near-death levels of boredom and they were overcome by a trip to the a pencil sharpener. A high five from a homie on the way by, or possibly a note if things were spicier in that class.

I salute you, pencil sharpener. My school had these in almost every classroom when I was growing up, until they remodeled in like 2008 and took them all out :("
4 year update on my full grain briefcase,"Are you a professor of Archaeology at a small coeducational liberal arts college?

**Edit:** Made some comments that didn't show up in the post.

This this is my daily carry for work, and as you can see is none the worse for wear. The leather is just beginning to get to that ""floppy"" mode. But thanks to the manufacturer installing a few well placed leather patches on the interior, it has maintained its overall rigidity and still sits upright on it's own. I've seen other leather bags that just don't stand up after a time.

Only upkeep I've done is an annual application of the conditioner that came with the bag. If anything I wish it would look more beat up! But the thing ages like Keanu Reaves.  
Still one of the best purchases I've ever made! Dumb question here... But  does the fact that in 4 years it's barely aged mean that it would be better to buy a used one if you want the slightly aged look? I imagine it's hard to find these used?"
"Its been dropped in a pool, thrown, stepped on, and lost. Always have a keychain usb drive.","Are there files you always have on it that you want to carry or is it just in case?

Can anyone recommend a particularly durable model and brand?

I imagine all keychain USB drives are not the same. Also it was my understanding that this type of memory only lasts about 10 years."

Well when it came time for production, he insitsed that he, not some tooling shop, needed to be the guy to actually machine the masters for the mold that made the shape. This was highly unusual, but that's how he rolled. 

Later the same guy made a wafflemaker that was the fastest in the world. Toastmaster model 245 was designed to beat any other wafflemaker on time, still making a perfect waffle. I contributed by doing some heat transfer tricks with the heating elements. 

I have a signed copy, with the designers name etched into it, of model 245. I thought that was a mound of peanut butter on the right."
"An article on Barbour jackets - ""The queen, when she sent her jacket back to us, we said, 'We'd like to present you with a new one, ma'am.' And her secretary said, 'Well, the queen would be very pleased to accept your kind offer, but she'd like her old one back, please, reproofed!'""","I picked up on (a cowin commando re-release) 6ish years ago. Ran it into the ground, ended up washing it which stripped all the wax out and then it sat under the bed at my parents house for 6 months or so. I was going to bin it but a local place did they could send it back to Barbour for reproofing. Took a while but for £50 it came back fully reproofed, all damage repaired and looking like new. 

With the right care at regular timesi have no doubt they really will last for life. How much do they cost, new? Neat article - certainly gives one a hankering for a classic Barbour. Thank you for sharing!"
"My grandma got this carpet sweep in the early 1960s she gave it to me when I moved into my first apartment.

"2004 Honda Pilot. Just turned 250,000 miles.","My 2003 is right behind that at about 235,000. I love mine and hope to have many more years with it in the future. I've met people before with older pilots thta have 500,000+ miles on it and they run just as good as mine. 

As mentioned before I love how easy these cars are to fix for the most part. This car didn't get me into doing my own car repairs but it showed me I don't have to scream at it the whole time I'm working on it.  For context the car I had before my pilot was a 1996 land rover discovery and that thing was a nightmare and a half to work on. I believe that has a timing belt.  Has it ever been changed? Honda tech here. The 3.5 drivetrain in those was bulletproof during Honda’s engineering years. Sadly they moved to a marketing company and relied on their brand name from the past and quality has gone downhill. My wife’s on her 3rd new Honda and this will be the last one. Each one we’ve had “ghost” problems with."

If the house is period matching then I really want to see it. How is it for baking cakes?  Four burners, and a pilot light in the middle. The pilot shoots four streams of flame out to light whichever burner is on. It is simple, elegant, and kind of badass. No electricity required."
This 1988 Stanley tape measure. They still make this model.,"I have one.   I don't know about BIFL, but its still going.. That's tape measure has hardly been used and is in no way a BIFL item. The Fat Max one is easy better and still not buy it for life if you actually use it for work."

 [removed] Oddly enough. A toaster. My grandmother’s toaster which only makes one slice of toast at a time that was given to her as a wedding present in 1936.  I didn’t pay for it (inherited it) and it still works and it’s in my kitchen right now. So, there you have it. The way you take care of things makes a huge impact on their longevity. Basically keeping what you can away from heat makes a huge difference. Hang dry clothes, use the delicate cycle on the dishwasher, hand wash plastic, don’t use metal utensils in non stick cookware…."

I actually can’t find an exact match for the model, since this product was released in the earlier days of the internet. I believe it to be a Sonicare Advance electric toothbrush. It is finally going to be retired this month as the switch has become stuck (the only moving part). The NiCd battery is still going strong though. I recently got the sonic-fusion.  It's a tooth brush with integrated waterpik.  It is hands down amazing.  The leap from regular toothbrush to electric is about the same as from just toothbrush to toothbrush waterpik combo."

"A British made, $300 toaster that I only paid 60 bucks for it at Goodwill. These things last generations","Am I the only one shocked that Goodwill sold a toaster for $60? Best toaster.

On the older models, if an element ever burned out, you could open it up with a screwdriver, pull the element, rewind the element it with the correct-spec resistant wire and carry on. You could replace the element for a few cents.  There were terminal posts to wrap and clamp the wire.

Also, check out the drop-in wire basket/clamps for toasted sandwiches. Has anyone actually had a toaster fail…? I feel like they just get dirty to the point (over several years) that I’d rather replace it than clean it, or opt for four slots over two etc., etc. I really cannot imagine shelling out $300 for a toaster. It just doesn’t seem like the class of kitchen appliance that warrants it."

•Before/After 1987 Vermont Iron Elm in Midnight Green• (Story in Comments),"Another of my favorite Vermont Iron Elm Wood Stoves came into the shop. It came in beat up, rusty, and broken. But this is nothing we can’t handle.

The owner and I agreed that the color needed  some updating as well. We decided on this show stopping Midnight Green by Thurmalox, which was an original color offered by Vermont Iron when these stoves were being built.  And I had an extra soap stone griddle topper to add to it that really ties it all together. 

As you can see, the nickel ash apron was just too far gone to save, the nickel plate was peeling off so we shotblasted it off and painted it to match the stove.  Then the handle and tree were put in the electrolysis tank for a few days to clean up any rust. Then polished and painted to perfection.

Then we fit all the new parts. Then reassembled the stove with brand knobs, new stainless ties and hardware.  And you can see the results are just amazing! 

Of course the client was overjoyed, and I was blessed enough to be able to save another piece of Vermont history! My dad was the original inventor/manufacturer of these stoves out of Waterbury in the 1980s! He will be thrilled to see someone restore it to its original glory! I’m sending this to him now :) You can check out lots of cool stoves over on r/woodstoving as well!"

Timberland waterproof boots purchased 15 years ago still keeping my feet dry,"Is this really a testimony to their tread longevity, or are they rarely worn. The tread is minimally worn, that's why I ask. I struggle with a lot of the footwear posts. 

I get through around one pair of shoes per year - not because they fall apart, but because they are literally worn out with a shiny sole that has no grip. Ok, I could replace it, but as I tend to wear walking shoes / boots, it's hard to get equivalent soles for shoes that are worn down. Admittedly, I walk quite a bit (and try to cycle when not walking - special shoes for that game though!) so I get through a decent number of miles between re-shoes.

I've also got shoes in the cupboard that are in excellent condition despite being quite old. Not because they are made of magic pixie-dough, but because I seldom wear them and anything left in the cupboard will last for ever.

In short, shoes are not buy it for life. They wear out if you use them regardless of how good they are. It's a bit like ""buy it for life tyres""...it doesn't make any sense. My tims are def. Not BFL."

My only concern is if it is BIFL. There's just a lot of moving parts and plastic on it so I'm not sure."

Shows very little signs of it's age.  I emailed them because one of the 4 fasteners holding it together fell off.  They apologized and sent me 4 more, just in case. It just might last the 100 years. [deleted] They have fallen out of favor with /r/malefashionadvice despite that being the place that really launched their success. The founder and employees apparently spread misinformation about leatherwork and the founder got incredibly rich off the company despite seeming to not really know a lot about leather and the company moving production to Mexico.

Regardless I still like their wallets because I don't really think anybody combined form and function and price in a wallet as well as they do. I carry at least 10 cards on me at a time and their ""business card holder"" wallet is the most compact good looking solution because it *doesn't* have card slots. ~~Every~~ Most alternatives [to Saddleback wallets] that have been suggested to Saddleback are ~~invariably~~ more expensive, so I really don't understand the people hating on Saddleback [wallets] for the price or quality.

I have the F-91W (their most popular one) and use it as my knockaround watch, since I like to wear a watch every day. I wear it playing golf, swimming (both pools and oceans), doing work outside. It's honestly far more durable than it should be. And if it eventually does break, it's only $10 for a new one. I love Casio, best value watches IMO. I've been wearing a DW5600 for about 12 years now. I'm wearing smart watches lately, and I hate that I'd become addicted to them. I used to happily wear my Casio, but now, it's like I'm expecting the damn thing to vibrate and it doesn't. It's stupid, it's my fault, and I miss my Casio.

At some point someone has to teach us the importance of applying White's Leather Preservative to our investments,"You should clean these with saddle soap and let them dry before conditioning or else you’re trapping all the dust/dirt/salt in there and they will keep breaking down as that mixture abrades the leather. [deleted] I bought these boots about 10 years ago, but never deeply took care of them, and they're starting to wear away under the laces where they first go into the boot.

this ball is streets ahead of any dog toy I've ever bought. Bark box brand super chewer. after a year of use.,"Streets ahead...It came up organically. I wouldnt go as far to say that no dog could possibly ever destroy it, but my two big dogs (who eventually destroy every toy, most stuffed toys only last an afternoon) have been working on it for a year and have only slightly dented it. additionally, I cant say for certain that it will last for life as I have not lived a whole life yet honestly, but I have very little doubt that it will probably last my dog's lifetimes at the very least (provided it doesn't get lost somewhere). another thing that impresses me about it is that it squeaks! I personally can't squeak it without stepping on it, but my dogs squeak it every once in a while. great buy imo. I got mine at cvs for 13 bucks. Challenge accepted. Just ordered one. So far mine has destroyed majority of “ indestructible “ toys."

Being only 25 I didn't live through the 1970s, but my goal with this area was to try and give it a 1970s New York loft Apartment vibe. This is despite the fact I live in the United Kingdom and also in the North of England lol, but I can dream I suppose.

The latest arrival were my 1970s Wharfedale Denton XP2 Speakers in teak which arrived with their original retail box just over a month ago. Also great to support a local Yorkshire company too!

For anyone curious my gear is mainly Pioneer and Marantz, although my Reel to Reel is an Akai GX 4000 D. All of it is in great working order. The only thing no longer working in the image is my 1969 Sony Digitmatic flip clock which seized up in April this year unfortunately.  Damn you even got those ubiquitous fake wood cassette storage bins, nice! Historically accurate."
"I’ve had the Red Wings for 9 years, but the real BIFL are the Fox River socks. I’ve had the same five pair through Ranger school, two deployments and 8 years of daily wear. No holes or signs of weakness.","Thanks for the post. I sub for practical items not for wooden trunks from 138 B.C.. I work in construction and sweat destroys my socks. The Church of Darn Tough here on this sub had converted me but i'm always open to trying different brands and I have never heard of Fox River. I'll give them a try. Bought a bunch in 2005 after I wore out my standard issue socks from boot camp and they’re still in great shape (wear them weekly).

I’ve since added a bunch more and I somehow haven’t managed to wear out a single pair and they’re all 5+ years old. [deleted]"
Our fully restored GE brass/cast iron fan…,"Wow. You did a great job. 

It looks stunning, which if I'm being honest might be a weird thing to say about a fan? But I love vintage, and love things that last. And this just looks beautiful.

"Finally splurged on some All-Clad cookware as I love cooking and always wanted them. It doesn’t hurt I’m cooking every night during this quarantine either, and I’m looking forward to decades of meals with them.","LOVE my All Clad skillet. Congrats OP. You'll be able to leave these to your kids some day. If anyone else is looking to buy but can't pay retail, I bought my 12"" skillet used on eBay for about $70 shipped. A little barkeeper's friend shined it right up.

A full set is very luxurious and I can't say I'm not a little jealous. If you're on a budget I think a single 12"" skillet will give you 85% of the functionality you'd get from the full set. Really what you're paying for is even, EVEN browning so I personally don't have too much use for the sauce pans and stock pots that I don't usually brown food in. My only tip is no point in investing in non-stick from all-clad. Non-stick not really designed for life so no need to pay the extra, IMO. We got a non-stick all-clad as a wedding present. Coating lasted 5 years or so.  The rest is going strong after 12 years! I have 3 All-Clad pieces...a 3-qt. saucier, a 2-qt. copper-core saucepan, and a 4-qt. copper-core saute pan. I purchased each of them on sale, but having used them, I would pay their usual asking price if I had to do it all over again.  

BIFL in the kitchen is good times. If you don't have one already, check out a Kuhn Rikon garlic press."
Any love for Purdy paint brushes? Wash them out well and they'll last decades. I've had this one for 15 years.

"Found a beat pair of boots at a flea market the other day. A stamp let me know they were manufactured for the Swedish army in 1967. Im on a really tight budget, but i was more than happy to fork out 10$. They look and feel great.","Now walk a mile in them so you can judge the fuck out of the previous owner. Those are the same shoe?   You did a fantastic job.  Great vision to see the potential there, too.  Many would have walked right by. How did you get the huge creases to round?  Do you have a shoe tree in there?"
Furniture is so frustratingly bad now a days.,"My parents built their brand new house, filled to the brim with all new furniture from a couple of specialty furniture stores around the SE United States. They paid a damn pretty penny for everything and even some items were so ""specialty"" made that they had to be ordered in months in advance to get to the house. 

I am not exaggerating when I till you the quality of all this furniture is just awful, especially compared to what they've paid for. Unpainted sections of the furniture all around and inside them, shoddy paint work in all little nooks and crannies, details in the work is chipped, unpainted, scuffed even before getting here and obvious defects just painted over. Metal pieces are so incredibly cheap, easily bent handles that don't stay in place and metal rings that constantly slip out of their spots. Whole pieces of these furnitures are knocked together with plastic inserts. So many spots of unsanded wood that'll just pick up dirt and dust.  

All this is from the dining room set, to their living room, bathrooms, bedrooms, and office. It looks like shit that you would find in the cheapest furniture stores 20 years ago. And let me talk to you about furniture 20+ years ago 

My grandmother has bedroom, living room, and dining room furniture that she bought 15, 20, and 25 years ago. Let me tell you, these pieces are absolutely fucking gorgeous, elegant, high quality made from HEAVY real solid wood. The metal pieces are fantastic, the drawers are perfect and close so smoothly. The paint job is great and these pieces all have this smooth, elegant curvature in its legs, table sides, drawers, cabinets, and fantastic detail all layed around. They've lasted so extremely well and even look modern in today's standards. Id absolutely kill to get furniture like hers, but I wouldn't even be able to find pieces near the same quality if I had to fill a house with them. Any piece I would find would look like shit compared to hers. 

Her furniture looks like insanely expensive pieces you'd find in those bougie furniture stores that no one goes into because they are too damn expensive. Want to know where she got all these pieces from? God damn fucking Rooms-to-Go and Big Lots. And none of it was ever expensive either, my grandparents were often on the poorer side, having to find the cheaper options they could get. But they just went into what ever store was available and had this kind of furniture easily accessible to them.

 Her couch from big lots 20 years ago has better build quality that blows my 1,000 couch I bought a year ago out of the water, which is currently falling apart with the inside stuffing just absolutely fucked. And I can't even properly fluff the inside back up because it's all cotton swab material that's held together by the most microscopicly thinnest material ever which has the filling spilling out of it. The fabric covers are falling apart at the seams and it's all such cheap quality that it's hard to even clean. 

I'm astounded at the quality my grandparents were able to get just 25 years ago at some regular big box store, while my parents could look around the whole country for a quality store and still can't get anything a fraction of the quality. And hell, maybe my parents just did a shit job with their research, but it shouldn't be this hard to go to a store and buy decent pieces. This is in every store I've ever been to, no matter where you go. You'll always find absolutely shit quality that every company will charge you out the ass for. It's so god damn ridiculous. Get commercial furniture. It’s made to withstand the public so it’s much better quality than retail. I work in commercial furniture and studied design, retail is doing whatever they can to make as much as they can including screwing over their customers. Factory outlets for Herman Miller, Haworth, Design within reach, or office furniture sales on Craigslist is what you want We buy as much furniture as possible at antique stores.  Excellent value for quality.  It is really frustrating. My partner and I bought a sofa from Crate & Barrel last year and it’s already making creaking sounds when you sit on it and is starting to show wear. I honestly have better pieces from Wayfair. Money doesn’t equal quality anymore unfortunately."
"My husband's first credit purchase, 1971, still used every day. Bought on a Macy*s card, $300 limit.","I dig this look so much, I am no fan of the current lifeless look of kitchens. Way too many people don't understand how credit works. It's only ""debt"" if you don't pay off your card at the end of your monthly statement period.

They battered it, crashed it. Kept running.

Hit it with a wrecking ball. Kept running.

Tied it to a pier at low tide and let the sea take it. With basic tools and materials they revived it in a few hours.

Set it on fire in the bed and interior. Kept running. 

Put it on top of a multi-story building and blew the building up. Still ran.

Gave up. Impressive! Vanessa Carlton could have just seen you tonight 500 times if she had gotten this car."
Leather Jansport backpack. Bought it Junior year of high school. My Dad thought it was too expensive. That was 1992. In 2013 the zipper finally gave out and rather than use the lifetime warranty i had a friend fix it to make sure i kept the bag and the memories.,"I have the same one. My mom gave it to me and she has had it for like 25 years. She carried my diapers in it and I now use it on a daily basis.  Does Jansport really make that good of bags? Even today?  I bought a cloth one in 2002.  Twice the zippers have gone out.  Both times, they not only replaced the zipper (first in a main compartment, and later in one of the smaller), they **upgraded it to a sturdier, sleeping-bag-weight zipper.**

At this rate I expect it to last another 80 years... I always recommend the CR-V to anyone who needs a reliable all wheel drive vehicle and font have a lot of money to spend.  The years with the full sized spare on the back are the best bang for you buck.

Pro tip for cleaning one of these: place a Cascade tablet in one and fill it all the way up with boiling water. Let it sit for an hour and all the coffee stains or whatever else will be gone. Love contigos and have several, but didn’t know they did this. Do you need proof of purchase or something?"
Denim Levi’s jacket my mom got in the 80’s,"I think Marty McFly's girlfriend had this jacket. Not worn often? Colors are vibrant and looks barely used

My mom used a similar 40s or 50s stove daily up until she had to move out of that house a couple years ago.

My old gamecube wireless controller is still operating and will last for weeks without changing the battery while my ps4 controller can't last more than 3days,"The resale value on those things is crazy good.

BIFL: Do you ever find it sort of infuriating how poor the quality of everything has gotten?,"It’s to the point where you are always having to replace or repair something, and when it involves a hobby you are never truly set up with your gear. 

I kayak fish and enjoy organizing and rigging but when things are constantly breaking or not functioning properly it becomes very disruptive and aggravating, interfering and sometimes even ruining my time on the water. OP, a bunch of people are saying “just look harder” but I am in the same boat as you are: stuff sucks. You used to be able to pop into a local store and buy a thing and not think about it again for years. I find that’s no longer the case. And it’s maddening. Either my local store doesn’t sell it, or I have to order it at that store’s online retail site and it arrives broken/damaged or shit built. Or I can buy something in town but it’s a piece of shit. 

I wish all of the posters staying the quality is the same but the price is higher would list WHERE they’re shopping and what they’re buying. My downstairs bathroom faucet is *peeling*. I installed it in 2018 because the one from the previous owners took Hercules' strength to turn on. My house is 119 years old and the original faucet was probably better than these ones. It’s infuriating. So many companies sell utter crap with no conscience whatsoever. Even big ticket items. It’s created so much work now researching before I buy most things. I even have to review reviewers, because a lot of them are paid and full of shit."
My Grandma just bought me some Dodco Inc coat hangers and they are identical to the ones she bought in 1969. Can you tell the difference?,"I've never pined for quality hangers before, what is this sub doing to me? I love old wooden Department store hangers. The advertising on the hanger, the quality build and materials and the price is great at yard sales is unbeatable. I think the older set is on top, it's slightly darker from natural aging. Also, the ends of the wire that are in the twist are crimped tighter to the hook wire on the old ones. 

Not saying the new ones are bad, but there's a slight gap that leads me to believe the machines producing them have aged."
I am the third generation to own this crock pot.,"Hey...I just wanted to give you a heads up that some of the pots on the older (and not so old) crockpots are glazed with products containing lead.

"I bought this (made in Finland) Fjallraven used at Goodwill years ago and, with coat of wax each year, it's a bulletproof barn and backwoods coat.","Please explain waxing clothing to me.

The insulation was pretty well clumped up but I washed with tech detergent and then ran through several drying sessions with tennis balls to break it all up and redistribute. It worked for the most part except some real stubborn areas (like the collar) but functions perfectly.

That tech wash stripped most of the residual ""Greenland wax"" out if it, so I used two jars of ""Sno Seal"" to give a total of 3 heavy coats (extra passes on the shoulders and ""yoke"") and then melted in the  treatment over the fire. Been wearing hard ever since.

"My grandmother's General Electric mixer, she is 93 and refuses to use the brand new Kitchen Aid one my aunt got her.","I think I’m starting to understand the older people on my life. The explanation usually
Is “it works fine” or “I already know how to use it” and in the past I would scoff at that, “sure grandma, but this one is *better.*” Now though, I’m starting to understand...

I don’t bake much but I make a widely requested and damn good chocolate chip cookie. Well I was having issues with my old, second-hand, hand-held mixer’s ~~mixing-attachment-things (told you I don’t bake much)~~beaters, so I found a new one I wanted and ordered it. Now it’s a fine mixer, but it took a while to get used to it, whereas with the old one I could close my eyes and still mix dough just perfectly. The new one took some getting used to and that’s just for cookie dough; one recipe I’d made for a few years. 

Imagine a tool you’ve used for 30 years, it’s not even an extension of your hand any longer, it’s a pure extension of your will. I wouldn’t want to replace it either. 

**edit:** remembered that they are called beaters. I can smell the ozone and motor brushes just looking at it. I have a similar vintage Sunbeam in Harvest Gold at my country house. The only thing I will use for Yorkshire pudding. First it’s probably built better. Second it still works. Third maybe she’s truly testing the buy it for life."
My 1952 Brown and Sharpe Micrometer Still Like New,"Looks brand new! As in never used! I've never seen these survive, they all seem to get dropped etc. What a gorgeous piece of equipment Is this to measure your dong?"
This is a functioning Singer sewing machine from 1928.,"Can replacement belts still be found? My MIL had a similar pedal style, but it's missing its belt. My mom still uses one like this.

She actually just found a place in LA that sells belts for it (hers just broke), but they are currently closed for the Covid. Bonus: No electricity needed."

"After 10 years of wear, I sent in my Bean Boots to get resoled. Here’s the results!","Please condition those leather uppers, road salt and water has dried them out pretty good. Hey everyone! I got these bean boots 10 winters ago, and I finally sent them to LL Bean to be resoled this winter. These boots are one of my favorite possessions. During the cold and rainy months, they my daily drivers; whether to work, the ski resort, taking out the trash, on the hiking trail, or walking the dog, they go wherever I go! 

The process took 4 weeks, door to door, to get the boots back, and cost about $45. I’m very pleased with the results, and customer service was very kind and informative when I would call and ask for an update on the pair. If you have a pair of these boots that need to be resoled, this is your sign, do it!! My bean boots have always been hella slippery. Is that normal?"

Current state of jeans (affairs),"Almost all Levi’s except for a pair of Tommy‘s and selected homme. I doubt that I wore any pair more than 50 times. Just beyond „mildly“ infuriating. If anyone has a recommendation for durable (and stylish) jeans, I’m all ears. I patch mine up at a tailor. Once done it looks seamless and it's more durable than before, so it seems like a better solution than buying a new pair.

But yeah, it's a lasting issue, I haven't had a pair that didn't wear out in there eventually. They’re all failing at the crotch because that’s where all the seams meet, there is the most friction, and, particularly if you ever bike, the most tension. 

One way to think about it is to imagine that your jeans are constantly trying to come apart to relieve mechanical stress, but because they are sturdily constructed (double stitched, riveted) they can’t come apart at the seam itself, so they come apart adjacent to the seam that is doing the most work. 

Duluth trading co has some good jeans that have a gusseted crotch, which essentially means adding a piece of fabric at the crotch that meets each of the seams separately to distribute the tension. Proof at huckberry also has some nice work pants (rover pants) with a crotch gusset if you want something lighter and more breathable then the standard Duluth offerings.

Levi’s used to make a commuter Jean that was reinforced so it had both a gusset and the standard Jean configuration on top of each other, but they phased those out of the second gen commuters (the crotch was a little uncomfortable with all that fabric but felt sturdy as all hell) and then phased out the commuter line entirely, to my knowledge there is no one making a Jean this sturdy in the crotch now. Your jeans are trying to tell you something very obvious here - you’re not wearing the right cut of jean for your body. Realistically need something with more room in the seat/thighs so there is less friction there."
My dad gifted this watch to my mom on their wedding day (Nov. 1983). She still wears it regularly.,"[deleted] I have a Longines winder given to me in 81, that still works perfectly fine. Has never had a tune-up even. Rados are great watches. I have one. Superb.

Popped my Le Creuset cherry for just $4.99!,Nice! anything you have to watch out for when getting used enameled cast iron? I have seen some Le Creuset dutch ovens on Ebay that I'd love to get but I don't yet know enough about them to pull the trigger on an auction. Anything you've learned in your process of acquiring this would be great!  With the Stanley cameo Be careful with this style of pan. They have a nasty habit of rotting 'unseen' deep within the wood to metal joint and detaching at the most inopportune time - for instance when moving them from the stovetop to a landing spot with a heavy compliment of food aboard. Not pretty when that happens. Never use this pan for frying or for sauteeing at high heat.  Did it come with the lid or was it missing?
My mom was given this as a wedding gift in the early 80s and it's still the only mixer she owns,"[deleted] I love how ""easy-grip"" just means that you can actually hold on to the damn thing.

A few weeks later, my dad got her a rotary phone for their bedroom. Guess what color?"
France pushes for product ‘lifetime’ labelling,"I support this, it'd bring some much needed objective measurement to trying to compare durabilities rather than relying on sometimes dubious claims of manufacturers.  Don't fret if it's voluntary.  Requiring SOME information, even if its' manufacturer-provided, across all products is going to be a net win for the everyday consumer.

For example: kids shoes.  My kid wears through his shoes like he's going for a Guinness World Record. If I actually knew that paying more for a pair is likely to result in a longer, harder-wearing shoe, then I'll probably do that.  Right now, I'm virtually convinced that manufacturers are purposefully making cheap, fragile kids shoes because they only wear them for a brief time.  The alternative: hard-wearing, durable shoes would mean a healthy secondary market.
Then, if one manufacturer's information is obviously inflated, consumers have some possibility for redress, like false advertising laws, which I'm sure are actually taken seriously in the EU. I’m pregnant. My maternity leggings that go over the belly, that I’ve only worn for about 3 months, have huge holes around the thighs and crotch. I have about 6 pairs in rotation, along with jeans and dresses. The leggings should definitely last more than 3 months and I would absolutely be willing to pay more to not deal with this embarrassment."

Just picked up a 1986 Maytag A312 for free. Best washer I’ve ever owned. Clothes actually get clean and smell good!,"Oh my goodness, this is the washing machine I grew up with. I can hear the mechanical buttons and dial just looking at it. Thanks for the memory!

It was still working fine around 30 years later when my dad passed and mom and sold the house.

I know my front loader won't last *that* long. Although, to be fair, it is about 15 years old IIRC and never had any issues. And it gets the clothes clean.

PS: my parents had an old Flair stove / oven from when they got married in the early 60s until about the 1990s lol. They had to replace a few things along the way but otherwise it just kept going. Kind of a neat, compact design with a retractable stovetop. These old maytags run forever and there are a shit load of analog replacement parts to swap out when they go bad.   I love my Maytag."
Y’all convinced me! I got my first pairs of Darn Tough socks because of this sub!,"I'm sad that I tried them out and they were too tight at the crook of the ankle & top of the foot for me, even going 1 size larger.

They are still an excellent company with no hassles about the return. I was on vacation years ago and forgot to bring socks for a hike we were doing after a swim.  The only store nearby was a mom-and-pop outdoorsy shop, and the only socks they had available were Darn Toughs, which I’d never heard of.  I was so pissed I was basically forced to buy a $15 pair of socks, but Space help me, they are my favorite socks of all time, and they are still going strong nearly 20 years later.  It was a revelation that socks could be that comfortable and that quality.  Enjoy your socks, OP!

EDIT:  Wait wait, hang on!  I don’t want to give the wrong impression.  I know 20 years sounds super impressive.  But they are crew socks, and if I wear them maybe 6 times over the summer (once every other week, based on our typical laundry cycle) that’s a lot.  So, let’s say it’s 17 years (I bought them sometime in the mid-aughts, so “nearly” 20 years), and I’ve worn them let’s say max 6 times a year, that’s barely over a hundred wears. I mean, they’re so comfortable and sweat-wicking and durable and I absolutely love them for hiking or biking or long-distance walking, but I also treat them like they were spun with gold.  Until I had to buy compression socks, they were the most expensive socks I ever bought myself, and I still treat them accordingly. I love my Darn Tough socks, so much so that I bought 14 pair and got rid of all my cheapo socks."

The [full report, unfortunately costs $1000](https://www.statista.com/page/Made-In-Country-Index) to get access to it seems.

Just bought a used Herman Miller Aeron chair for 160 bucks (CAD)!,"I'm new to this sub, but just to give you guys a quick run through on this chair.. if you are looking for it used: expect to pay around 250-300 depending on the age and features of the chair. Companies that are liquidating these chairs never paid anywhere near the retail price, common discounts bring these chairs to those in the industry for 700-800 a seat. Lower if your company has real national or global pull. 

Look for cracks around the seat pan and bending of the hydraulic cylinder. Aeron's were once single piston cylinders and they could bend if you were north of 250. Older versions of this chair had star nuts on the amrs to adjust the height of the arms. Newer versions have latches, and there are 3 different lumbar supports that offer different feels for this chair. Check the amount of adjustments under each side. Right side should be the height adjustment, left side could be one or two or no adjustments. Higher end chairs have 2, chairs that only have a back tilt limiter back have 1. Those that don't have any adjustments were meant to be conference room chairs. Squared off arms are another sign that the chair is newer. Older styles had rounded very glossy arms, that didn't tilt inwards or outwards. 

See my other comment on the sizes, 90% of the people out there will fit a B size chair. Smaller people would go for the A if you are especially petite, and C is for those of us who are north of 250, and over 6' 2 ish. 

Best of luck. Also if you are looking for quality chairs that last a very long time, try Steelcase Leap chairs and Steelcase Amia. I keep the Leap chairs aside for my ""troublesome"" clients who claim every chair in the world is too hot or too cold. The Humanscale Freedom chair is also a good chair, just longevity is a bit fickle. Humanscale does honor the warranty and gives very little hassle in fixing issues. Anyone remember when these were the symbol of dot-com era excesses? Didn’t Fast Company have some Aeron chair theory that when a company bought them, it was on the edge of collapse?

"My girlfriend’s grandma gave us this Kitchenaid from the mid 80’s. It’s in almost perfect condition except for a few scuffs that give it some character. It still has the manual, all original attachments, and it works flawlessly.","My wife's extended family is large, and they all believe in owning a KitchenAid. So I have become the KitchenAid repair guy in my family. Randomly. Somebody sends me one quarterly to fix, but I think I'm finally caught up and I'm not going to have too many more.

From the failures I have seen, Here's what I would do with a vintage KitchenAid.

The very first thing I would do is inspect the power cord. At this point it's probably getting very close to 40 years old. A lot of the insulation on those go at about that age. 13 bucks or so and you can get a new appliance cord.

Next I would check the brushes. They're underneath the black caps on either side. I think they're like $3 a piece, but I've never really had to replace one. Make sure to remember the orientation they require before putting it back together, they'll only go in one way.

After that, I would make sure the speed steps are adjusted properly. There's YouTube videos on that, and it's a 5-minute thing.

And finally I would replaced the grease. I'm practiced at it at this point, but it takes me all of 35 minutes. It's not hard at all, but you do need a punch and a flat head Screwdriver. There really is no way to misassemble it either, so it's really not a bad maintenance job to do. If you decide to jump into it, there is a brand of grease called super lube, that makes NSF certified food safe Grease for these things. The old grease in the mixer can vary from the consistency of water all the way to the consistency of wax, and everything in between, but usually what I see is something about the consistency of bread dough, from all of the flour that gets thrown up into it over time. Made in the glory days of Hobart-made KitchenAids. Take care of it, they don't make them like they used to :) That thing will last forever."

Christmas present buying guide,"If I’m buying for other people- IE not my wife or kids- it’s ALWAYS something consumable. A nice wine or bottle of Bourbon- depending what they are into. An art or cooking class, a year subscription to something like skillshare etc. there are so many options out there to get people gifts without bringing more junk into their lives.

My wife also knits- so people also get stuff like gloves, and hats. Sweaters if she really likes you. I guess upper left would be a pet rock? Alternative take: Instead of buying ""item"" gifts, consumables like foods and drinks are also great Christmas gifts! Especially for those who do not have the privilege of living in a home with spare space i.e. those who rent, those who share their living spaces with many people, or those living in smaller places like apartments."
Swedish sledges; bought 40 years ago. Still in use.,"Right, but what could you even hammer with those? 40 years ago was the 80s. Not the 60s. Fuck. Well designed plastic items can last a long time. My plastic garbage bin sits outside all year long--100F to 0F--and it's fine after 24 years.

I'm sure plastic things that break are either poorly designed for their purpose, or designed to some minimum spec that is expected by the designer to break after so much time or use."

But I have gotten better at standing my pen on the tip, so I’ve got that going for me.   And this pen also doubles as a hood prying device when you need a little tool to pry something open.   Such a great pen, I’ve seriously thought of getting it as a tattoo. It's also the most commonly used prop pen in movies and TV.

My 1962 British built Hacker Cavalier portable. Still going strong after almost 60 years.,"1/5 Chair was uncomfortable. Would not sit again. This was my Christmas present to myself this year. Its a wonderful portable system with a Garrard type 50 auto changer and a 3 valve rectified tube amplifier. A lot of folks consider it one of the best sounding portables from the 1960s. It is certainly nicer sounding than similar Dansette’s and Fidelity units of the period.

Hacker gear was built in Maidenhead, Berkshire UK. Unfortunately they get forgotten about a lot as they went bust in 1977. 

The condition of this unit was very nice to begin with. However, the amplifier has just come back from being recapped and the turntable serviced and relubricated, so no doubt she’ll be good for another few decades of faithful service at least.

I Mainly got the unit to play my collection of 45 singles in succession and it does that very well. However, 1960s acoustic stuff also sounds lovely and mellow on it as well, Bob Dylan sounds especially good. No doubt thanks the lovely refurbished valve amplifier. The rear of the unit also has a tape in/output so I can plug in my iPhone or iPad and provided I set the iOS device to mono mode, also have a retro valve amplifier to use with Spotify.

The chrome stand is something I made myself out of a 1970s swivel dining chair. Hacker did actually sell something almost identical to this for the later mid 1960s Gondolier model. These official stands are extremely rare and hard to find nowadays, probably costing more than the player.

How I got a $1789 Miele vacuum on marketplace for $80,"Pro tip: I regularly sorted listings by “newest” and tried different incorrect spellings. This one was listed as a “Maille” without the model name listed, and it didn’t come up when you spelt “Miele” correctly in the search bar. It also didn’t come up if you typed “Brilliant,” “Miele C3” or “canister vacuum.” 

In spite of having been listed for only 1 hour and being difficult to find by search, the seller told me someone else was going to pick it up the next day for $125. I told him I’ve been looking for one for a long time for my allergies and offered $200 and pickup. Long story short, I got it for $80 after the seller called me to tell me that his wife smelled a slight odor by the motor and didn’t feel comfortable selling it.

I told them it was probably the filter ($60 replacement) and said it’s no biggie. They felt more comfortable offering it to me for free, but I paid $80 to drive out and meet halfway for pickup. I could never have afforded this new and was about to give up my search, so I’m very grateful. 

**Tldr:** I got a gently used $1789 vacuum for $80 by getting creative with search queries on local marketplaces, monitoring listings by “newest,” being personable with the seller and talking to them on the phone. Plus a dash of luck. This is the opposite of ""I know what I have"" sellers. Nice find. TIL theres a vaccuum that costs $1789. Wow. Score."
End of an era Pizza pan lasted ~25 years..finally time to consider a new one !!,"Drill a hole at the base of the crack to stop any further spread.

What I've learned about couches.,"I've spent most of my adult life buying 2k couches and have always been disappointed in the cushion life. I've gone as far as getting prices for an upholsterer to replace the foam and it's not cheap, almost the same price to replace the couch. So in 2019 I decided to splurge on a 5k Ethan Allen couch. Fast forward to 2.5 years and the cushions are already failing.

This whole experience led me down a rabbit hole on the quality of cushions and the overall couch construction and how they differ between brands. I did not research down cushions because I prefer a firmer seat (not sink in). What I found is that your average 2-3k sofa uses a foam density between 1.6 - 1.8 that breaks down fairly quickly. When you get to the mid tier brands the density improves to 2.0 - 2.5, although some will still offer a 1.8 (Ethan Allen) as an option. These mid tier foams will still break down (depending on use) but are not 10+ year foams. Fyi a higher density doesn't necessarily mean a firmer seat, for example a 2.0 can come in soft, medium, or firm. Next my research led me to the longest lasting cushion you can buy, the spring down cushion. It can also be referred to as spring foam, or spring fiber depending on the material used. It's essentially constructed like a mattress using coils (Marshall coils) to consistently keep the cushion shape. Unfortunately only the high end companies offer these cushions as options. Most of these manufacturers are located in North Carolina, Highland House, Wesley Hall, Sherrill, King Hickory, Taylor King, and Hickory White to name a few. Along with better cushions these companies offer better construction, such as stronger hardwoods (maple, mahogany, walnut, and oak etc...), eight way hand-tied suspension systems, and more quality fabric options.

Two weeks ago my nephew got married in North Carolina so on my trip I was fortunate to visit a store that carried a lot of the above brands. In the past two months I've sat in a ton of couches (Room and Board, Crate and Barrel, RH etc...) but nothing compares to what I saw and felt in that showroom. The quality was definitely there. I ended up buying a Wesley Hall couch on my trip and I'm hoping this investment pays off.

My intent on writing all of this is to hopefully educate people to learn about the construction and materials before spending thousands on cheap couches, like me. To replace couches because of cushion failure is a racket for the couch industry.

 My mid-90’s Flexsteel couch cushions are still perfect. Might depend on usage - none of my upholstered pieces have had cushions break down. If you have removable couch cushions you can order custom cut foam with Dacron wrap for pretty cheap. There are a couple different sites that offer this but we used [Foam Factory](https://www.thefoamfactory.com). You just put in your cushion's measurements and choose the foam quality/density. We went with HD36 High Quality which has a density of 2.8lb/ft3 and is rated for 16 years. I don't actually expect it to last that long but so far after 3 years it's holding up great. Our cushions are 23""x25""x6"" and it came out to about $45 per cushion with the wrap. Top quality post here"

"Still hungry for dust 40+ years later. I mean, come on WTF did they make these things of? Tank parts?! It still looks and works as if it just came off the assembly line.","My father-in-law used to sell the really expensive Rainbow brand vacuum cleaners years ago. He said he would always go to these houses and do a demo where he used the rainbow against the homeowners vacuum.  The only vacuum that could ever beat the rainbow was the old cheap bag vacuum from the store “Hoover style” or something.  He said if you had a brand new bag in the vacuum there was no way they were going to buy the rainbow. I inherited a beast like that while in college. Second time I used it, the thing caught fire (and the bag was empty, too!) The cool thing about this vacuum is that they still make it and parts for it, though they label it as the “professional” model. I have a vintage tan eureka and it does amazing.

"I got this pot from my ( now passed) aunt, she got it when she married in early 50's !","Look at this guy, cooking pasta sauce on a handed down pot, on coals with a trivet.

I'm honestly jealous. a Brief story of this pot: my aunt married in early 50, she was really young and she pent her lifetime with her husband, since i've memory that pot was used every sunday to make pasta sauce ( no need to say she was form naples ! ).

My aunt Carmela was a heartwarming woman, she never had any child so she adopted me as nephew ( she also was my grandmother sister ) and she always take care of us with love, when she was alive her home was a safe place with something to eat and fresh clothes anytime you need.

as i said this pot was used to make tons of sauce for the sunday lunch for years , i keept it and i'm still using for the same purpose.

&#x200B;

the only maintenance i've done to it ( and the cover too ) was a complete polish for removing scratches and no more . Reassuring as I've got a GreenPan that looks very similar. Full stainless steel. It's at least 10yrs old & used pretty much daily!"
"This Parker ballpoint was given to me for being a paige boy in a wedding when I was 5, at 24 its still holding up well. Only refilled 3 times","Amazing you didn't loose it. Full honors to you sir.

Used it that way for years. 
Well one day walking around london with a lady friend we stumbled past the mont blanc store. We had a nose in the window.. then I saw a pen like mine.. well it turns out the entire time I've been chewing on a £700 pen.. inlaid with silver and gold.. do you think my teeth Mark's add value?!?!

"My grandparents' Toastmaster. They've both since passed away, but the toaster keeps toasting. Originally bought circa 1956.",">[The old Toastmaste](https://rvnerds.com/2017/06/17/my-trusty-toaster/)r was made when the minimum wage was just $0.75/hr, meaning it would take over 30 hours at minimum wage to buy one.  Interestingly, inflation-adjusted, the minimum wage is about the same now as it was then.  That would put the basic toaster’s purchase price today north of $200.

Anybody want to spend $200 on a toaster today?? To your awesome grandparents 🥂 I have one of these but I'll tell you what sucks. Bagels weren't popular  (except as an ethnic food) when these were invented and bagels do not fit in them. The slots are very small. Intended for the thinly sliced bread that used to be everywhere.

My mom's 34 year old microwave from 1988,"This Tappan microwave from 1988 still runs great. We are having a birthday party for it next year to celebrate 35 years of service 😀 That microwave is so old it's redshifted into a radio wave. ""TAPPAN""

Just picked up a speed queen washer/dryer set for $350 from a guy who used it at his restaurant. I ended up having to disassemble the dryer to squeeze it down the stairs but if it lasts as long as they say they do I won't need to worry about a new one for a while,"Wow! Quite a score. Speed Queens are often the only ones people can get into basements because they’re designed to be dismantled to fit. Those are really recent models, too. Quick FYI, commercial restaurants use a lot of oil and grease (surprise! lol) and that can cause fires in a dryer if they weren't using a degreaser. I'm not sure what areas you need to check to prevent this but do make note of any funny smells and if you ever smell a burning scent stop it immediately. If a fire does happen, remember that it's technically a grease fire and do NOT apply water. You just stole $3k appliances! Congratulations! 

Check and see if the owner registered them. If not see if you can so that you get the rest of the 7 year warranty. 

I suggest watching a couple videos from this channel:  
[TC vs TR ](https://youtu.be/9mxottr_ZAQ)

Why is everything such crap now?,"I feel like an old man saying this (28), but why is everything crazy fake wood and priced as if it's heirloom hardwood? I'm looking at dining table sets and different pieces of furniture. It's like 1400 usd for this plastic feeling ""wood"" that should be at most 200-400


Edit:
Thanks for all the replies! I haven't touched real hardwood since I was a kid. Even floors are plastic now. 

I'm doing what others suggested and looking into crowd source things like Facebook marketplace and refinishing things myself.  Even local shops are all veneer and mdf where I am at.  When I was your age *in my shaky old man voice* everything was still shit. Now the shit is more readily available. The shit can be delivered within a day, or even hours if you buy the right shit. Amazon sucks, wish sucks, wal mart sucks. It’s all shit. I’m feeling the shit winds blow, Randy BoBandy, and the shit hawks are circling. I’m 37 btw. American manufacturing doesn’t have a pulse, and nobody is doing anything about it. Bring in that Chinese shit. Let’s rejoice in saving that 10 bucks. I feel like everyone else has done a good job of touching on the why's of it all.  I would like to chime in and encourage you to look up consignment shops and thrift stores near you.   Older generations with all the hardwood furniture are getting rid of it (or their inheritors are), so check out the second hand market.  Seriously, I've seen many people lamenting online that the furniture is great, but since everyone rents tiny apartments no one has room for their parent's furniture.  Getting even a little money from consignment is great for them, a great deal for you and saves something from ending up in the landfill sooner than it needs to. I can throw a rock and hit about 30 carpenters. You'll pay for it, but if you can do finishing work yourself there are deals to be had.

I paid $200 for a locally-made pine end table because I couldn't find something to refinish myself, threw a few coats of milk paint on it and it's good for the next decade or four."

We’re too poor to afford cheap things,"But I just wanted to share something with you guys that I think you’ll find interesting. 

All my life my parents have bought random junk made from cheap plastics that would break or be obsolete within a year. Honestly half the stuff were just gimmicks and I always hated having that junk clutter the house. My parents are not what one would call financially wise and made some mistakes to wind up in debt. I love them to bits but I’ll call out their flaws, one of which was excessive spending on things that weren’t even of quality. Since then my mum has improved dramatically on that topic (dad not so much). 

A few years ago I met my partner. Her family lives by one rule that I’ve adopted for myself in my day to day life. 

*were too poor to afford cheap things* 

That honestly changed my life. I’ve filled my home with things I only deem of high quality otherwise will forgo buying anything all together. I’ve filled my home with pots that’ll never chip, clothes that last years longer, appliances that will last decades, and I’m more comfortable financially because of it. I’m still a student living in an apartment so most of this has yet to be put to the test when I move to a bigger home but taking this wisdom into my life is gonna help a lot. 

I guess this is appreciation post about the quality of things while also looking back at a motto I’ve taken upon that has changed my life. I’m not advising anybody to go blow their money on buying the most expensive things out there either. By combining that ideal with thrift shopping frequently, you’re bound to find gold. 

I’m not sure if this post breaks the rules but thought I’d share my thoughts. I love this subreddit and all it stands for!

Edit: guys we’re poor stop spending your money on Reddit stickers. I appreciate but buy yourself a thrifty find instead :p

A lot of you are mentioning how for the very poor, affording to spend that extra buck isn’t a possibility for many. I agree 100% but I believe that topic covers a greater scope of what this post can address. To change that we need substantial socioeconomic change in policies and whatnot. 

And while that may be totally true about buying new, for a lot of things you can totally thrift, trade, borrow, refurbish and so much more to prevent from buying that brand spanking new thingy, buying second hand applies to this mantra too!

Edit 2: like 20 of you have brought up the guys expensive boots. It’s a great way to picture this problem from the poor man’s perspective. Agreed. 

We say ""I'm too poor to buy cheap things"".

My husband works in a machine shop and we would have to buy new pants every 2-3 months. Work pants are not cheap, and even with sales, I was paying $50-75 for each pant. Now we've discovered duluth trading and I havent bought pants in 2 years. Totally worth it to spend the extra money for good things. My philosophy on buying stuff is to buy an inexpensive one first, and if it isn't useful I'm not out that much money. If it is useful and breaks, then go all out on the next one. If the cheap one lasts forever then I accidentally bought something for life.

EDIT: I should say that often many people, myself included will conflate cheap with inexpensive. Don't buy something poorly built, just something inexpensive. And I, like everyone else, has exceptions to this philosophy. It also takes a load of your mind. My parents always had cheap, crappy appliances that broke often and were constantly worried what was going to break next. Every weird noise the machine made sent them into a spiral of worry and ""How can we possibly afford a repair or replacement?"", even if the machine didn't break after all.

Having reliable, long lasting things puts your mind at ease."
"My dad bought me this Lamy in 2007.

"60 year old Barber's chairs. My father and I have been putting them to good use for the past decade. They still have ashtrays, and they feel like rotating a tank turret when you spin them.","My childhood through adulthood barber passed away a few years ago.

TIL: Henry vacuum cleaner parts are still compatible with models made forty years ago,"With utility BIFL items like this, always look at what professionals in their trade use. Power tools, cleaning supplies, cooking utensils etc.

Most cleaners I have seen use this, because as others have said it's reliable, simple, no-bullshit. So I therefore have a Henry 😁 I absolutely love my Henry - it's just an awkward plastic bucket with a big fan and a motor to suck up grime. My dad used one as a shop vac in his engineering workshop, and I bought mine when I left home ten years ago and it's still chugging whatever I throw at it.

I admit they're not for everyone though - they get stuck on corners, they're loud as hell, no modern features at all (two settings: high and low), annoyingly heavy and bulky, and it looks like it's mocking you every time it rolls away in exactly the wrong direction. But I love that it's repairable, and that the hose is still a standard oil drum size thread because that's what they used to be made of. But it cleans stuff real good, costs c. £100, and last decades. Best hoover I've ever used. On, off, no bullshit. I've heard quite a few people complain about them but that's mainly because the last person was too lazy to empty the bag (which can smell). I've also heard of them being used daily on building sites etc.

They look iconic too. I'll always go Henry over the likes of Dyson"

"My Great Grandfather's Elgin Pocket watch, made in 1917. Passed down to my Grandfather, my uncle, and now me","Beautiful. I have my great grandfather’s Elgin as well. Not sure of the date, but probably not far off from yours. My great grandmother had it engraved with his name before she gave it to him. The back has a locket where she placed a photo of herself. Capt. Koons 

>	This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First World War in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be damned if any slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you. Hey I'm from Elgin! Love seeing history from my community pop up like this. Really crazy how the old watch factory in town supplied half the pocket watches in the country at one point


Fun fact: The Elgin watch factory used an observatory to keep their watches accurate to a tenth of a second (unprecedented at the time). After the factory closed down they donated it to the Elgin school district and we used to go on field trips there every year to see the star show. Good times."

Red Wing Boots my pops picked up in 1975: before/after new soles and conditioning,"I’ve got a pair at home that look the ones on the left. I landscaped in then for years.

I'm from Stillwater (about an hour north of Red Wing) and it took my 30 years to buy them.  If I ever have kids, I'll make sure they get used for 30 years after I die so that we can all confirm they're BIFL.

I'm pretty handy as far as keeping footwear/leather in general on working condition, so I have no doubt they'll last that long."

Dr Martens busted after only 6 months. Careful when believing the hype.,"Hate to say it but I don’t think anyone who knows shoes calls Dr. Martens BIFL anymore. Maybe the Made In England ones (better leathers to start with) but the regular Smooth leather nearly always wears out in creases and creates holes. Red Wing brand boots, specifically IMO the Iron Rangers, are a good option (pricey for MSRP but you can find seconds or gently used pairs for the price of good Docs) that’ll last you forever. Someone mentioned Solovair boots which I’d agree with if you’re dead set on having DM-like boots (their factory used to make the older/better Docs back in the day) but they still have somewhat lesser leather. Same with Corcoran jump boots, they’ll last you longer than a pair of Docs. If you really want to go into well-made combat or “service” boots I’d look into the Pacific Northwest bootmakers like Viberg, Wesco, Nick’s and Frank’s, but these boots start around $500 new and can go WAY up. You can customize them how you like tho, down to which last they use so that it better fits your foot type.

I’m sorry your Docs gave out, it happens far too often with that brand. There are however other options out there, hopefully you can find something better!!! Those aren’t BIFL anymore. They caved and now produce crap products. Solovair are the originals who branched off and maintain the bifl quality The hype ended 20 years ago"

My Father got this as a safety award in 1994. He passed away in 1996. I’ve been using this original Leatherman for over 25 years!,"I still have mine from that time.  Maybe a year younger or older.  I've kept it oiled, so it's pretty much free of rust.  A few chips in the blade, but otherwise it's still tight and works great. That’s amazing. Mine is 20-21 years old, and the only maintenance was sending it to them to sharpen the scissors 2-3 years ago. They’re built like tanks! Nostalgic and functional. I still use my original Leatherman my father gave me, daily. The hand engraved “From Dad Christmas -97-“ is a bit faint from years of pocket change. 

When the sad days finally come, the only thing I’m demanding of my fathers is his collection of Leatherman tools. Has had one or more on him for as long as I can remember. 

Appropriately, I bought my son his own (original model) when he turned 15.  Ironically, my father has also gifted him a few.

I put the work in and gave my old Tumi a second life,"You did a really good job with that! That stitching is impressive. Excellent job. I remember many years ago Southwest Airlines gave me a neoprene luggage handle wrap because i earned a ""companion pass"".  It was just like yours, except very shitty. I had a Tumi messenger bag I bought in 1986 that I put through hell and it just didn't care. I climbed a mountain with it. Halfway back down I was too tired to carry it further so I threw it off a cliff. Hiked down and recovered it. It was fine. Lots of stuff like that, and it was fine.  The only problem I had with it was all my fault, I left a stick of deodorant in it, while it was in my car during the Las Vegas summer. It melted and the entire inside was covered in a slick film I couldn't clean out. 

I kept it for a number of years after that and one day decided to put it in the washing machine with hot water. It kinda worked, but not quite all the way. I then made the mistake of putting it through a second hot wash cycle. The interior lining flaked away and the small leather square on the front shrunk pulling in the ballistic nylon around it. It was still usable so I kept using it.

I was showing it off to a Tumi rep I ran into in the Chicago airport in 2008  (weekend of the Republican national convention) I told him I kinda wanted to get a new one, one made for a laptop which weren't really a thing in 1986.

He emailed that night and said he'd get me a new one if I let him have that one, because his g/f worked in marketing and she thought she'd mike like to use it in an advertising campaign. 

I left it in my hotel in Chicago. Maids thought it was trash and threw it away.  He still sent me a new one which I still have.

"Scotch brand desk dispenser (for tape, obviously). Cast iron, made in Canada.","They’ll like this over at r/castiron for sure.

Nvm. I see you’re way ahead of me. My question of my entire office working life is: “Where do the office supplies go?  The staplers, the scissors, the rulers, the tape dispensers?”  I’ve never had them break. I’ve never had to throw them away. So why do I have to keep buying tons of them on new projects?  My parents have had the same pair of scissors for 40 years. That is a murder weapon"
"Coleman lanterns 1965, 1973, 1977","Their iconic product! I have an older Coleman gas two burner stove that's easily 50 years old, but looks and works perfect. [deleted] Stayed at a campground where the Coleman enthusiasts where having a meetup.

They were a great bunch and showed off their collections with everyone. 

Also, didn’t need to use my headlamp- it was slightly brighter than a full moon all night. A lot of propane was burned that night."
My Apple II from 1982 and my iMac. Only the Apple II still works and it was in an abandoned factory.,Just a note that old PCs/Macs that still work and are that old are worth hundreds to even thousands of dollars now because people collect them. Even cheap emachines are going for a few hundred on eBay. Slides in Oregon Trail floppy. Is it possible to tape repair or upgrade old iMacs? I have one from 2017 and while it still works it's unbearably slow.
Shock Cousteau spent 2 days submerged in a hot tub,"Pretty impressive watch. Those things are beasts.

My dad bought gave me one before I went on an exchange program to the USSR (back during Glasnost when absolutely nobody predicted they were going to spectacularly collapse a few years later).
When we got there the black market guys all tried to trade for hard currency.

The common items for sale/trade were crappy rabbit fur hats and cheap Komandirskie ""military"" watches. They asked to trade one of those for my G-Shock.

I told them I'd trade but only for a sable hat. They didn't think it was worth it so I took off the G-Shock and threw it on the concrete as hard as I could. One strap popped off and they laughed at me. Then I put the strap back on and asked if they wanted to put their watches to the same test. They just walked away.

It's got a few more scratches but it still works as well as it did when it was brand new. The only time I've ever replaced a G-Shock was when I lost my G-Shock. Guaranteed it's still ticking away at the bottom of that river. I'm upvoting for title, but I'm not angry about it at all."
Ode to my beautiful red pot,"Thrifted this 10 years ago for $12 and use it every day! 1970s Dansk Kobenstyle 3qt Dutch oven. It’s so pretty it just stays on my stovetop. I love the design and because it’s carbon steel,  it’s much lighter than cast iron and easier to use on the stove. I use it for truly everything and the lid doubles as a trivet. 100/10 design! When I got it someone had burnt rice onto it and since then ive revived it several more times without chipping the enamel inside :) 
Highly recommend the vintage ones since they’re about the same price on eBay as the new ones. Just check that there’s no enamel chips on the inside past the rim.  I found the aqua version at a thrift store and love it. Has anybody compared the new ones to vintage ones like this? Any decline in quality? I love this design, and would really prefer to just get a new one if they're not inferior. Our yellow version of this is our ""just the right size"" pot for many things"
"After my last post about restoring a Coach briefcase for our nanny, a redditor contacted me about restoring the same bag.

Game Boy Color. The sound is a bit quiet but I can still play Super Mario Bros.,"I have the same Atomic Purple GBC! If we're going to mention Game Boys then I have to bring up the Game Boy Advance SP. It's practically unbreakable, the battery lasts forever, it has a backlight, it feels comfortable to hold despite its size, and it's easy to carry around. I think it's the ultimate r/BuyItForLife handheld console. Do you want to fix the sound?  Is the volume knob not seeming to work?.  If so there may be a simple fix for you.

Let me know."
The late Queen definitly was a BIFL gal,"There is something beautiful about having a garment with you through all the stages of life. 
My granny was of the same generation and i learned alot from that mindset. Just last year the old vacuum she bought in the early 70s hoovered it’s last.  Oh yeah, there are articles about her Barbour jacket too. She sent it in for repairs and they offered to give her a new one and she said no and wanted hers. It’s easier when you are using the absolute highest quality products from legacy brands. The queen has the best of both worlds for BIFL: quality material and quality aftercare.

Most BIFL products featured here have just some percentage of both. Looks like a different coat. Stripes on the arms in the old pic run a different direction than the stripes on the arms in the more recent pic."
My mother had this in the attic brand new 1960s mix master.,"[deleted] It's so rare to see old things in a native brand-new state, unrestored. We're used to seeing things missing paint and parts, it's nice to see this. Anything is buy it for life if it is never opened."
"We see regular requests for headphones here, so I compiled a list of the top 30 headphones on Reddit (r/headphones)","This is just mentions, not ratings. FYI. Just passing through this sub but if the idea is buying something for life then things like AirPods or others with internal non-replaceable batteries shouldn’t be on the list.

Those batteries are going to degrade and thus the product becomes unusable. Surprised Sony 7506 is not on here. Not my go to for pleasure listening but they're pretty ubiquitous in studios for monitoring"
"When mom busted this out, you knew the meal was going to be good","This meant 1/4” thick pork chops cooked for about 45 minutes in crisco until they were curled up and had the consistency of boot leather at my house in the 1980s.

My dad repaired a Herman Miller Aeron from the side of the road and gave it to me as a gift!,"The other day he found some busted chairs on the side of the road and I told him ""I know this chair, these things are hundreds of dollars!"". He doesn't care about chairs, understandably, but being the computer guy of the house, I was looking online for more ergonomic chairs. Luckily, this one only needed new wheels (taken from my old busted chair) and some plastic welding on the back of the seat. Outrageous upgrade from the $100 chair ive had for 2+ years Everything works fine, looks pristine, and it feels great to sit in! Hell of a chair and hell of a roadside find. Kudos to dad!  
I suggest activate and take advantage of Forward Tilt function on this thing. From the levers I saw, I think you have it. If you work the keyboard for an extended time, it allows you to sit in an optimal position...you can't slouch if you tried.

Check to see if you need to replace the foampad at the front/under the pellicle mesh, it helps with frontal comfort + keeps the mesh nice and tight. You can find replacement for $10-15.

Enjoy the chair. [deleted]"
I inherited this blender from my grandmother. I have no idea how old it is. Still runs like a top though.,"i remember those, my parents had one. No idea what year but it's older than the 80s i bet. Great blender though. The feel of those buttons is very satisfying. A gentle curve cupping the finger tip with slightly raised tips at the corners of the button. My parents had this! In fact, my Mom still does. AFAIK it’s from the 70s."
Where BuyItForLife products are made,"(abusing my mod powers to sticky my own comment)

A lot of these companies while based out of their respective countries their products are often made elsewhere. 

I really like the subreddit r/BuyCanadian to try and buy and support domestic production.

r/madeinusa seems to be the American version.

r/MadeInBritain also exists but is quite small. Uniqlo is BIFL? Since when ? This isn't accurate. Lots of Craftsman tools are made in China and Taiwan now, and DeWalt stuff is global."
This Sears Kenmore “Coldspot” refrigerator has been chugging along since 2004.,"2004 being used as a benchmark for a long time ago makes me feel old is 19 years BIFL worthy? 

If so I probably have been lucky with my appliances Agree the modern refrigerators are not designed for longevity, but this tread peaked my curiosity.  November of 87 is the date on the beer fridge my basement."
Birthday present from my wife. I’ve always wanted a pair of LL Bean Boots!,"How did you decide which version to get? Seems like there are a bunch of options with minimal difference between them. I’ll never forget seeing the Bean Boot sailing along the highway past me one day when I was driving through Maine on I95. Thought I was hallucinating hahahaha I was just fuckin’ around drinking with my cousin in Salem and we drove up to Freeport and stayed at a bed and breakfast down the road from the L.L. Bean HQ campus. I had no idea the size of that place. I wanted to live there.

Edit: Had to look up where we got absolutely plastered since the town is a ghost town and nothing was open. Only place open was Gritty McDuff’s."
Got this backpack when I started high school in 1997,"Jansport ruled the 90s backpack game. But I tell you, you won't get the same quality as you have there if you were to buy it again. 90s saw a great exodus, maybe the last great, of manufacturing jobs and quality has dropped for many old great products. [deleted] I have my moms green suede jansport from college (late 70’s). My dad bought it for her when they were in school, and then she gave it to me when I went to college. I’m 30 now and still love love love it."

Panasonic RF-930. I think it’s been on nearly every day for almost 50 years.,My dad still has his. It's in the garage and playing classic rock right now.  It was in my dad’s dorm room in the late 60s and for as long as I can remember was tuned to NPR in my parents’ kitchen. Some of my favorite childhood memories involve listening to it while my mom was cooking. When they retired and moved they passed it on to me and it still sounds as good (maybe better? I’m probably biased!) as their new digital radio system.  My grandpa still has one like this.  We used to sit on the back porch and listen to baseball on it.
This camera has been going strong since the 1960s - everything still works flawlessly,[removed] Where can you buy film and get it developed? How did he take the picture!!!!???
My favourite cooking knife. Sharpened twice in 20 years,It’s a Kyocera Ceramic knife. Still made today and if I ever broke this one I would find another regardless of cost How was your tomato? How is this even possible ... is ceramic that hardy?
I bought this Seiko with my first raise. 1985.,"Looking sharp! What have you had done to it? Looks like the crystal was replaced - if not, it must be made of unobtainium.

My husband bought his first Honda Civic new in 1998. He gave it to his parents who still drive it daily. We were in the market for a used car to haul our two dogs around. Got ourselves a 2005 Honda Civic. It still looks and drives like new!,"Civics and Corollas seem to be the only cars that really don’t care what environment they’re put in long term Is it Netherlands?

"Plow truck my grandpa bought brand new back in ‘79, been working every winter","That's impressive. Plowing is pretty hard on vehicles. ...that name again is Mr. Plow! Yeah, an old HiBoy will do that. One of our farm trucks is a '78 that just keeps going."
"Osprey’s “All Mighty Guarantee” does, in fact, stand by “any reason”","I had seen some posts on here from years ago that claimed that Osprey’s “All Mighty Guarantee” was no longer honored, so I wanted to give an update that at least in my experience, it is most definitely still honored.

I’m a longtime Osprey customer, and all of my hiking backpacks are from them. I’ve had my Daylite for probably around 8-9 years, and before taking a trip I found a hole chewed through the back panel. I decided to see if “any reason” truly means any reason, and put in a warranty request. Around 8 weeks later and a very good experience with their customer service team, I have a brand new Daylite. They even let me choose which color I wanted Nice! A few years ago they totally replaced my Osprey Aether. It's a great move businesswise because I've bought additional packs since and never fail to applaud their products and service. I lost the top portion of my 65L Osprey on a canoe trip and they mailed me a new one free of charge!"
"Great great grandfathers wallet, still in daily use","Found this when emptying my grandfathers house. It had a note in it addressed to my grandfather saying that it originally belonged to his grandfather until he passed away at which point it was used by his father. I have now been using it for the last two years and it is in great condition. Its had extensive restiching by me but natural cotton will rot with time.  National Insurance Card is also pretty old school 😂 Awesome wallet btw, can't help but wonder how many more generations it will see what kind of wallet? I want one..."

Unfortunately, rust is such a major factor with cars in a lot of places. This one looks to be in really good shape and something I find with most Toyotas in this generation is that you really have to try to mess something up."

Pleather and sweat is a bad combination You can easily replace the ear cups on these Sony headphones. “Wicked Cushions” on Amazon are pretty great. I ordered a pair for my Bose QC 35s and they’re fantastic. They sell silicone cozies for them in 90s colors, too. $16-30 for brand new look and feel."
ALL STEEL 1975 cub cadet. NO PLASTIC!! It has a clutch and manual gear box (no belts). This thing is BUILT. I’ll NEVER buy new .,That’s legit.  Looks tough as nails. My dad had a larger one of a similar vintage and just gave it up about 5 years ago. The John Deere he replaced it with has been nothing but trouble unfortunately  BIFL status will depend on part availability though. If something wears it has to be repairable.
The ‘Ove Glove! Best and most durable oven mitt. I actually bought this for my Grandma and then inherited it when she died.,Mine have gotten quite old but I still use them on the grill and in the fireplace.  I love them. Just don’t get them wet before or during use. Definitely agree. Mine has had almost daily use for 15 years and is still doing its job.
"Coleman 4 person tent I won in the 8th grade.

Well over 100 camping trips and no rips or tears. 10/10","11 years of use and the tent, poles, stakes, and rain fly are all in great condition. In addition, it has kept me dry in some downpours. Also kept me sheltered down the Golden Coast on a multi-week camping trip. Please note that that's the old Coleman. Modern Coleman is crap in all honesty. We have a similar tent that’s about 18 years old and the zipper is just going now, a pole broke a couple years ago too, and it leaks in heavy rain. Still using it but looking for a new Coleman one. Disappointed to read that the quality isn’t the same though."
Scored a used set of All-Clad D5 stainless steel pots and pans,"Got a great deal on a set of USA made All-Clad D5 stainless steel pots and pans.

Please send her to my DMs in a few months when her new set gets ""ruined."" Nice score 😉 Do you guys put your stainless pans in the dishwasher?"
50’s ice cream scooper that my mom gave to me.,"might be due for a bit of a polish. I have this exact scoop and it works great! Got it from my grandmother’s house after she died. It’s at least 30 years old, probably more. It’s hard to find a good scoop. I always break them in half."

It takes up a fraction of the counter space and has been going strong since the 1970s.","I remember my mom's, unfortunately hers only made it to late 90's.  You're right about the space though, I remember how much more compact it was. Yes! I am the owner of a 4th generation teal sunbeam with all the original parts. I’ve got a newer model of this right now, and it does not seem to work well for me. Any suggestions? It has dough hooks and a few other attachments, but the bowl never moves when in use so whatever I’m mixing never gets incorporated well. Especially when making bread."

"Got an old Skil drill from some guy that said ""Skil tools stink; take it"". 10 years later, this thing is still reliable and indestructible.","Maybe it just smelled weird to him.  Not saying these are bad. But, 10 years is a meaningless metric. If you use this tool in your role as a homeowner it is likely that you have put on less hours in 10 years than a professional would in a week.  Skil is great in terms of indestructibility, they're just shit when it comes to precision.  Doesn't matter much for a hammer drill :D"
27 year old Porsche Design spring activated titanium keyring,"I bet the other 2 rings are 50 yrs old.  I had one of these! Really liked that pinch to open feature but alas, the hooks eventually bent and the hook can detach from the cylinder.

Dry Guy four prong shoe dryer. Used 6/wk for around 18 years. The knob broke off but they were smart enough to have a keyed shaft such that a butter knife works as a replacement.

Or even an old stove from a junk yard or something. I have one of these in my garage, left there from the previous owner. For me, it's been in use for 22yrs, 3+ times a week, running all night.

I begged and pleaded for him not to sell it but he wouldn't listen. He told me that no one would want it anyway and that I could keep it if i cleaned my room. 

It took me less than 10 minutes to clean my room and in that time it was the first thing sold at the garage sale. Since then, I have never cleaned my room... I'm 36 now Trinitrons are something else.

This GE Fridge from 1942 at my friend’s house works perfectly,"[deleted] So I had to open one of these up once and the insulation was—-shredded bark. Yep. Also, the bark had settled so the top 1/3 of the door had zero insulation. If possible take the door apart and replace the insulation! In high school, our theatre department had one of these as a prop. It probably hadn't ran in 40 years. It smelled really bad inside. Unfortunately, it was scrapped after that.

These days I have a Sebo, compared to it the Dyson used to always feel cheap and plasticy. I got a DC14 at my bridal shower in 2009. Still going strong after 14 years and a 12-year-old pomeranian."
We tested over 60 different nail clippers to find the best,"Nail clippers are one of those tools that everyone has in their house. You probably won't give them a second thought until it's time to give your nails a trim. 

Given that there was no exhaustive guide on nail clippers and thesweethome's top pick recommends the nickle-plated Muji's (good but not great)  and the awful tweezerman barrel spring nail nipper, we thought we would get snipping to see if we could find something better.

**Which country consistently manufactured the best nail clippers?**

 Japan blew the competition out of the water when it came to nail clippers. Germany and Italy, normally well known for their steel workmanship fell short. 

Rubis was the only Swiss entry however while they cut well, they were near impossible to track down on American soil. We also could not justify the price considering the Japanese models cut as good if not better for a lower cost.

So the best nail clippers in each category are as followed:

##Fingernail clippers (small nail clippers with a curved blade).

**Best all rounder**  Seki Edge SS-106

**Best precision fingernail clipper**  Seki Edge Satin Slim SS-109
(a narrower choice with a smaller blade)

**Best budget fingernail clipper**   Kai 003 S
 (Identical to the Mehaz 660. Kai manufacturers many Mehaz nail clippers)

##Best Large Nail CLippers (Larger clippers with a curved blade)

**Best all-rounder**  Feather Parada M

**Also Good**  Greenbell Nail Clipper G-1008 (It was virtually a tie between these and the feather Parada M)

##Toe Nail Clippers (Large nail clippers with a straight blade)

**Best straight toenail clipper**  Kai 003 L

**Best Angled Toenail Clipper** Seki Edge In-Grown SS-104

## Nail clipper set (One big clipper and one small clipper)

**Best performing**  Seki Edge Craftsman (Also sold under the greenbell brand)

**Best budget**  Harperton Klipit


##Travel Nail Clippers

**Best allrounder**  Tweezerman folding/ Victorinox Multinail

**TSA Friendly**  Zwilling J.A Henckels Ultra-Slim

##Swivel Nail Clippers

Kai HC1824 360 Degree

##Easy-to-Use

Three Seven Extra Large Nail CLippers

##Premium Nail Clippers

Khlip Ultimate Clipper - For fingernails

Kershaw by Kai - For toenails

##Nail Nippers

**Best allrounder for the price**  KlipPro Toenail Nippers

**Best performing (under $100)** Suwada Classic


*****

##Interesting notes:

**Despite being a favorite on r/buyitforlife the Concord nail clippers didn't really impress. They were identical to the Kiya nail clippers but with different branding. While it may have been impressive that the concord clippers come with a leather clipper catcher, it didn't work as well as the plastic catcher that came with the Kiya. The Kiya nail clippers can also be picked up for a fraction of the price because they do not have the leather catcher.

**Tweezerman and Sally Hansen's quality appears to have taken a dive. While older models of tweezerman and Sally hansen were favorites among the staff,  Affordable and effective. newer models were of much poorer quality. We were able to track down an old pair of each to make the comparison. Surprisingly, after years of use the older sally hansens cut better than our brand new pair.

** The worst performing nail clippers we tested were the Italian made Premax. Despite looking great in all the online photos, the jaws were severely misaligned on all our test models and the blade edges were jagged. They were outperformed by drugstore nail clippers.


**You can't rely on brandnames. While Seki took out many of the categories they also had nail clippers that we wouldn’t recommend to our enemy. Same was true of all manufacturers. In addition to this there are lots of brand names that simply white lable other nail clippers. Mehaz rebrands Kai Nail clippers. Khlip while well known for their premium made (and priced) sells a modified Kai 003 nail clipper base for their clipper set.

**If you have thick, fungal or bowed nails then no lever style nail clipper is going to work as well as a good pair of nail nippers.

 It's 18:19 on a Wednesday night and I'm online shopping for nail clippers. Where did my life take this turn? Well. That's fucking thorough.

Edit: damn, those premium clippers are more expensive than I thought. 

 Holy shit, I was just thinking about this the other night when I was clipping my nails. My clippers really suck, so I was wondering if anyone had done a list like this. ...Then I forgot to look. Thanks!"
Vitantonio Waffle-maker bought at Disney World in 1995; built like a tank and working great after 24 years of pretty regular use!,TIL you can buy a waffle maker at Disney World. The best part is filling the ears up with whipped cream I have one of these too!  The ones they sell now are not nearly as high quality.  Ours still works like the day we bought it.
"BIFL smokers companion, the Proto Pipe. A brilliant design, made by hand in America.","Great piece of kit....BUT...hot as hell and just oozes resin if you use it too much without cleaning

They are still pretty great, but these days, glass is so inexpensive that I prefer to use a spoon or chillum that only costs $10-$15 that I won't feel bad about losing if I need to toss it. I can feel my lips burn and smell my burnt bangs, Cleaning the resin from the removable screw in the base is a chore though and it's hard to remove it all. Just have to clean frequently I guess."
"Pro Tip: If you want a 'buy it for life' item, visit a rental shop and see what brand/model they use. They buy the proven durable and lasting equipment.","[deleted] It’s a decent rule of thumb, but not entirely true. Rental companies make their decisions on more factors than reliability. Mostly it’s a financial decision, and also depends on the deal they’re given by equipment manufacturers and distributors. Not true so much. I manage a bicycle, kayak, paddle board rental shop.

We are not going to spend $600+ on good kayaks and paddle boards, just for people to treat them like shit.  
 We also buy many used items, cost fraction of the price and easily replaced.

We have mainly lower/ mid-range equipment. Cheaper to repair and replace.

"My dad bought this seiko with his first paycheck when he was 16, wore it every day till he passed, hasn't missed a beat since I was 16!","Most keepsakes are relegated to some dark closet. This wonderful reminder of your father is used every day in the very same way that he used it. Does not get better than that.

Beautiful watch also! Watch nut here; for those that don't know, Seiko is a highly respected watchmaker,  right up there with Rolex and Swiss neighbours. They invented the quartz watch,  and they build almost everything in-house, including lubricants and LCD's. They're still innovating in mechanical watches (the 'Grand Seiko' line),  and support the art with scholarships and the like. 

Also, they spun off Epson printers from their R&D department. 

Enjoy that watch.  ""I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years"""

"I was traveling to Japan last year out of Los Angeles and had chatted to a guy about his Filson rucksack — he’s had it for over twenty years and finally had to replace the shoulder straps which Filson replaced at no charge. He’s always waxed the twill every five years, and leather every two years.","Filson is great stuff but can be a little hard on the pocket book ""Waxing the twill"" sounds a bit like a British euphemism.

Has a failed zipper on the top lid, though, and some chunks eaten out by mice. But still goin' pretty strong."

The 30oz Ozark Trail tumbler is identical to the YETI tumbler. The only differences: name and $30.,"Now they need to copy the coolers and sell them for $40 Can attest to the quality. Lid stays sealed, ice lasts throughout the day. Haven't tried hot liquid yet. 

They sell a 20oz as well.  I have two of the large ones from Walmart.  I hate to admitting to liking anything from Walmart, but it keeps ice for over 8 hours in a hot truck during a Texas summer.  The only bad thing I've found is toy have to bring extra water because the ice doesn't melt fast enough to be able to drink it when you run out of water."
"Thanks to this sub I decided to look at buying a used grill before going and getting a cheaper new one. Found this $150 on Facebook, put $25 into fixing it up. Cleaned it up and it’s good to go",That’s a $950 grill.  You are the winner.  Use it for good and post the results. Weber has tremendous customer service and truly stands behind their products.  Back when my Genesis developed a mysterious leak (tanks would go empty overnight without use) they sent me a part that would be the likely culprit without any hassle.  When that didn't work they sent me the next likely part without any hassle.  When that didn't work and basically my entire propane system was now new I opened up that side burner panel and found that the valve had been turned on to its lowest setting.  I never even thought to check that as I hadn't used it in like a year.  My guess is that some visiting family were playing with it and when they went to turn it off they turned it in the wrong direction.  I told Weber what happened so they could close my case and they just laughed and thanked me for letting them know. What was wrong with it and how did you fix it?
My new-old overnight bag. Inherited Grandfather’s gym bag. 70’s pleather w/riveted on handles & those old steel zippers that never ever break open.,"Content removed in protest to API changes killing third party apps and the ongoing enshittification of Reddit. Go to Lemmy instead. Going to elementary school in the late 70's & early 80's, these were ""the bag"" to have as a school bag.

We'd put our arms through the handles and wear it like a backpack. 

In the winter, it would get rock hard in the cold, and would slide on ice and snow like a rocket with  little effort.  After some practice, we'd become pretty adept at chucking it like a curling/bowling throw, and take out our friends legs from underneath him.  Good times.

There's a movie that was made in Quebec back then called ""La Guerre des Tuques"".  In English it is ""The Dog that Stopped the War"".  The kids in the film had the same bags.  Watching it brings back all the memories. These are made out of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), an oil-based plastic that, when it degrades (usually from time and heat) will break down and leave a sticky oil film on everything it touches.  
If it ever becomes sticky it's useful life is over.
Edit to add; it stinks, eats metal (loves collectable coins) and should not be consumed.  Ain't plastic fun?!"

"Same photo, same bag, same quality but......","My sister lived in China for some years.  She said there were three kinds of counterfeit goods, in order of cost from High to Low....

""Fell off the truck"" - These are the actual goods, sold at a discount on the streets that somehow ""fell off the truck"" and were found ""randomly"" along the road.

Out the back of the factory - The factory makes Filson bags, but then they insert a ""Y"" junction on the assemobly line.  Some to go the Filson branding station, and out the front. Others go to the ""Paxson"" branding station, and go out the back.  Same product, same quality, just branded differently.

Filsoon Bag - This is a total counterfeit good, with a very similaly spelled name but in no way represents the same level of quality.  You see it and think it's the product in question, but on closer inspection, you see the spelling error(s) and realize it's not the same. As a comparison point: In the US, the Filson version sells for $199 and the Paxson is $136. And both are massively overpriced"

"The Fight for the ""Right to Repair""","Whenever something breaks, Google the problem. Chances are someone else had the same issue and posted a fix. My dad gave me a large flat screen TV that was 4 years old and wouldn't turn on. The TV repair place told him it would cost more than the TV was worth to fix it. I googled a fix, ordered $5 worth of new capacitors to replace the bad Chinese batch of was built with, soldiered them in, and it works fine to this day. We have a motorhome. Recently the fridge stopped working.

WE thought our only choice was to get a new one - with labor it would have cost around 5 or 6 thousand dollars. We would have to leave it at a repair place for several days (a couple of weeks?). The entire windshield would have had to be removed to get the fridge out (it won't fit through the door). 

As we were contemplating what to do - we were told about a group that have gotten together - around the country. They remove the fridge, lay it down on the floor and repair. 

Our repair took a day and cost $1500. 

It is ridiculous what some repairs cost on RVs. Believe me - we kept the information for future use and will pass it along to anyone we meet on the road.

The  guys that repaired ours were in Tennessee and they were a Father and son. Really great guys, hard working and appalled at the RV industry's idea of ""repairs"" should cost. Does anyone know of a website or service that ranks or reviews items in terms of durability, repair-ability, or planned obsolescence?"

[Source.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/sears-sells-craftsman-brand-to-stanley-black-decker-1483623215)  [deleted] I think we all know that Craftsman hasn't really been BIFL with most of their tools for a long time (though a lot of their hand tools are still fine) so this may be a good thing for BIFLers (if Stanley B&D decides to make it a premium brand) though they already own Stanley, DeWalt and Black and Decker so I have no idea where this brand will fit in."
This camping table set bought by my grandparents in the -60s just saw its fourth generation of users. The tent is on generation two.,Where did you get a balloon animal while camping? The ICA bag is apparently BIFL as well I’m actually more impressed by the tent lasting 2 generations. I could never get more than 5-7 years out of one. I mean they were still intact but got leaky even with seam sealer.
My trifold Coach wallet that I got for my Bar Mitzvah is more than old enough to have its own Bar Mitzvah (2006),"You should throw it a party and get it a tiny trifold as a gift. Coach wallets are bulletproof. Coach makes a solid wallet, I’ve had two and a passport holder. Unfortunately, the piping has come off one of the wallets and I said screw it and got a Smathers and Branson."

I created a community where you can get convinced to not get stuff you don’t need,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Doineedthis/

This is where I could have gotten convinced to not get a paint brush saver (a ziplock bag does the job just fine) or where I could have found out what to expect from a cheap set of sheets. 

Join our community and become the enemy of “as seen on tv” and other entities that try to sell you cr** you don’t need. My dad has been painting for 30+years, taught by my grandpa who also painted for 30+years. Don't even bother with a Ziploc, just wrap the brush in an old plastic grocery bag that you were gunna throw away anyways. Put It in the fridge and it will be fine I like the idea, but I'm not sure it was needed.  Let's discuss it over there though. Like the idea....but I have a feeling that if I need to ask, I dont need it."
Update on the family heirloom the Gold-leafing !,"You’re supposed to put the gold INSIDE dumdum! I went back through your posts to see the progress, great work!

Is that scrap gold leaf on the floor in the final picture? lol"
My friend’s apartment is from the 1950s and came with its original Tappan oven.,"Ewwwwww carpetted kitchens... Probably a silly question, but I worry about older stove tops like this because a coworker of mine had her apartment burn because of an accident with an old stove...

Do the knobs ""click"" to the off position? Her old stove did not, and one afternoon while she was leaving to run some errands, she accidentally brushed her stove with the garbage she was taking out and the stove top turned on. She didn't notice, and while she was out, the stove heated, caught fire to a pan, and her apartment was burning within an hour. 

From what the firemen told her, it was because the knobs didn't ""click"" into the off position, which might have alerted her to the mishap when she bumped it on the way out of her place.  Wow that looks like the one we had in the 1970s era mobile home i lived in as a little one."

"Vagarant Traveler C.E.O. 17"" backpack briefcase in coffee brown","Bought used for $110. A small touch-up with some leather grease and it's good as new!

It's also got two smaller pockets on the inside as well as 3 penholders. I intend to carry this as a satchel, but I've also tried it as a backpack and it is incredibly comfortable!

The +30year old adidas sports bag that was my mother’s and i still use today,"If you throw it in the laundry it'll look even better! Nice! Quality seems to have changed over the years (unless I got a “bad bag”). My adidas bag fell apart after three years- the lining on the inside came off in bits. Was super bummed. Amazing.

Finally joined the Darn Tough sock club!,"Nice, man - I love DT socks too! However I found that their light or thin socks are less durable than their hiking socks, which are great. Nothing unexpected, but just letting you know.

btw, GoBros has -25% on DT socks at the moment if anyone wants to stock up (I'm not affiliated, just a happy customer). I've probably got 20 pairs of DT, a handful of Fits, Smart wool, and Kirkland signature. Here's how I'd rank them:

1. Darn Tough. Haven't had to file a warranty claim yet, but most of mine are the heavier hiking and hunting socks. They're not quite as soft as some brands, which makes sense because they're meant to be tough. 

2. Kirkland. Comfortable, fairly long lasting, and CHEAP.

3. Fits. By far the most comfortable and softest, but also the shortest lasting. Fairly expensive.

4. SmartWool. Not very comfortable or soft. They have been fairly long-lasting, but that may be because I don't like them much and rarely wear them. My favorite story about Darn tough, was someone through hiking the AT with only 2 pairs of DT socks. They eventually wore a hole in one and DT overnighted a new pair to the next stop!"
Good haul this year - Darn Tough Socks,"I bought a pair of these on the recommendation of a girl working in a sports shop before hiking the Grand Canyon.

Don’t know why we don’t see more Opinels in here. $17 for a knife that will outlast you.,There was a post about them at the top like a week ago I think it’s because the same could be said with many decent-quality knives.

Why were we cut out of this? Why did she leave it to the toddler?!
Aunts and uncles lost their minds, accusing my parents of conspiring with grandma to cut them out of the will, and my parents didn't know wtf was going on so kept proclaiming innocence.
By the time it was figured out, things had been said that couldn't be unsaid, and I didn't get to have any cousins growing up. Props to grandma for a bit of cuteness at the end, I personally think it was adorable and funny, and hell yeah I loved that farm, but wow. People are idiots.

"Fresh from Norway, my custom Ekornes Stressless chair","I love the Ekornes recliners, but be aware - peoples’ heads have quite a combo of oils and acids in their hair, even clean hair. Without regular cleaning and conditioning of the leather - say, annually - the leather will eventually break down and you will have a raggedy-ass hole in your gorgeous chair. 

Source: personal experience. I was wandering around an antiques store in Tampa FL many years ago and they were rearranging to put one of these in the front. Price tag $400, Condition nearly perfect. I had to crawl underneath to make sure it was a real one. Saw the label, paid, and carried it home. Best purchase that trip! Kinda related story;

My grandpa passed about 5 years ago. Avid deer hunter, but he didn’t hunt his last 10 years. His deer stand sat abandoned the whole time and slowly rotted. Finally about 2 years ago the wind knocked it over. I discovered this a few months after it happened and was picking through the mess. I found the mangled remnants of an authentic Herman Miller lounge chair from the 1960’s. I mentioned it to my dad and showed him a picture of what the chair was supposed to look like. He said that chair was in there house as a kid, got moved to his shop in the 80’s, and finally ended up in his deer stand.

Looking around quick online this chair are worth up to $10k+. I couldn’t believe it."
Honda HR214. About 30 years old and still starts on second pull.,"I had one of these from the mid 80s. It still started on the first pull every time until someone stole it two years ago. I’ve posted this before, but my dad was always a Craftsman guy and always taught me to buy Craftsman products. Bought a house about 8 years ago, and in the first two years I went through 2 Craftsman mowers. Third year, I bought a Honda. Six years later the Honda is still working perfectly. My brother then bought a Honda when he saw how much I liked man. 

Damn Sears and Black & Decker for running Craftsman into the ground.  Honda mowers are really the best. I mowed for my BILs lawn mowing service one summer during HS and I used a Honda commercial push mower. It was a tank, and if you cranked the speed all the way up it could pull you about as fast as running speed. If you weren’t careful it could easily just drag you around the yard all day.

Not a Honda salesman but I’ve had my fair share of lawn mowing experience..."

Long video but this woman’s skates caught my eye,Amazing story and woman. Everyone could take a small life lesson from her no matter what you do.  I have nothing in common with this woman other than a strong desire to sit next to her looking across that Lake while she tells stories.   That woman retired 7 years ago from a factory.
My great grandfathers tape measure.,Taking inflation into account 3inches back then is like 6 inches now. That’s amazing!  You could be the 4th generation to measure their cock with the same tape measure! Looks like a diameter tape that foresters use to measure trees. Did he work in the woods?
My Gillette adjustable safety razor. Likely from 1960s or earlier. 10 pack of blades costs about $2 USD. Shaves smoother than any other razor I've ever tried.,"There should be a date code on the underside of the blade guard that will tell you when it was made. The letter is the year it was made and the number is the quarter of the year it was made. For example, F4 would have been made in 4th quarter of 1960. I use a Perfecto badger brush and William's Mug shaving soap with it. It feels amazing afterward!

Nicks are extremely rare, I never get razor burn, and I never get ingrown hairs, anymore. I've been using this razor for about 10 years. Bought it at an antique shop for a few bucks and it's still like new. The only thing multiple blades do is trap hair and make themselves useless before they're even dull."

Props to you for taking such good care of it. What part of the country?  It's pretty much impossible to find *any* daily driver that old in New England due to salt use on the roads in the winter.  Any classic vehicles around here are garaged for the winter."
My parents bought this Steiff brand rabbit when I was born. Held up to me teething and all sorts of abuse. Slept with him every night well into my teens. I'm 25 years old now.,"Wow. Steiff is an old toy brand that’s of quality. Didn’t think that their products would last this long though. I’m stunned that it still looks so new after 25 years. What's his name?

I remember watching her sew it.

The fabric at the seams finally gave out and it basically fell apart."
"After six years and six can openers, I finally spent a few extra dollars and bought the same one my parents have been using since the early 1980s without a single problem. Swing-A-Way can openers are indestructible.","EZ-Duz-It is also a reputable USA made can opener.  Can confirm. My mother currently has this one my grand mother gave it to her.  It is 20+ years old and used basically fail.  The handles are yellowed but it opens cans much better than my $12 one.   I got a swing-a-way for my wedding and after 15 years, my mother in law came to watch the kids while we went on a weekend getaway. Got back and she had replaced our can opener with some starfrit garbage “it doesn’t leave sharp edges so it’s safer for the kids”. (My approach on the topic was educating the kids, and childlock on the garbage cupboard.)

A month later it was trash. Spent the next 3 years buying replacement can openers at ever increasing price points every six months and wondering what the hell was wrong with a world that can’t make a decent one that would last longer then a furnace filter.

Got fed up. Searched r/buyitforlife and bought a swing-a-way.

Now when the MIL comes over, we leave out a garbage starfrit one for her to use, and hide the swing-a-way."
Gillette - The Best a Man Can Get!,"I was just about to ask, been considering getting one but I haven’t actually given myself a clean shave in a while. Being in school I did more often but on break I just use an electric razor from time to time, my skin seems less irritated by the one I have but it’s not as close a shave. I picked up this 1930s Gillette safety razor in an antique shop for like, 20 euros in Turku. It came with a snazzy travel case and a case to hold spare razors.

If anyone is on the fence about trying a safety razor, you really should give it a go. It will save you quite a bit of money on razors and the shave you experience is considerably better. Not to mention its better for the environment as there is no plastic to worry about. 

Plus, they last forever pretty much. [deleted]"
Had to visit our local judge recently and this child of the 70s was playing in the waiting area.,"awesome piece of history!  i've been looking for that fabric in case any readers want to tell me what it is...  want to make retro speakers and this would be great. Old Sony stuff is the best. It really was a step above the competition back in the day, in quality and in price. I've got a beautiful 70s wood Sony stereo receiver that absolutely cranks. And hooked up to a Chromecast audio, it never will go obsolete! And if something breaks, it was actually designed to be serviced. TFM-944W that’s probably 45 years old.  Certainly older than most of the “customers” who were waiting their turn in court."
Dr Martens 1460 (UK) purchased 1992,"Canadian winters killed mine.  I had a pair in University in 92, lasted two years.  MAX.

"[META] Some stuff isn't BIFL, it's just a hunk of metal.","We get it. Cast iron pans last forever. They *should*, they're giant slabs of metal. Short of letting it rust through, there's not a whole lot that you can reasonably do to damage it, and there's no huge difference between any two kinds of cast iron pan. The only real difference I've ever read about is that some older pans were cast in a way that produced a smoother surface, thus more anti-stick. Some microabrasives and elbow grease can polish any modern pan to the same standard.

A knife? I mean yeah I *guess* a knife can be reasonably worn down over a lifetime if it's not high quality... but unless you're a serious outdoorsman, your knife probably isn't subjected to enough use to worry about it *not* being BIFL. You've had the same kitchen knife since the 70s? So's everyone else. It's a knife. Unless it's super low quality and the handle falls apart, you drop it and break it, or you oversharpen the heck out of the blade and wear it away to nothing, normal usage in any situation *other* than prolonged wilderness survival stuff doesn't really do much damage to a knife. If you've bought a kitchen knife that *didn't* wind up being BIFL, you probably either messed up with the knife, or you bought a really, really bad knife.

You've got your great grandmother's silverware? Once again... it's solid pieces of metal. Nothing moves. I can't imagine what one would have to do to wear out a *spoon*.

For God's sake, there's currently a *metal mixing bowl* on the front page! It's a *bowl*. It's made of *stainless steel*. If you don't literally cut it in half, it's gonna last for centuries.

Just because it's old doesn't mean it should be posted here. No one benefits from knowing that you managed not to break or lose a large piece of metal. 

/rant

*edit* Okay guys I get it. Good knives are better than bad knives. Not disagreeing with you. I think that a *discussion* about any of this stuff is perfectly fine. Cast iron vs Teflon coated? Great thread. Metal vs plastic bowl? Sure, why not. Jay Fisher knife vs Kershaw? Absolutely! I still don't think anyone would benefit from seeing the knife I carry that hardly sees any use and is still around after many years, despite not being of exceptional quality. If you're gonna actually post a knife of exceptional quality? Great! But your dad's $12 knife from 1981 that's opened some Amazon packages isn't relevant here.  My calculator still works.  [deleted] This rant got me thinking - I started lurking here because I believe in the idea of spending money where it makes a difference.  A lot of the stuff is old and either not being made anymore, or being made differently.  How much does past performance of a product determine future value?  I have some electronics that I bought after painstaking review / research.  Turns out that the vendor went cheap without changing the model.  ""Oh you got the VR001MxF made after 2017?  Bad move dude"".  So look at this knife I got 10 years ago does not mean the same brand is made today.

I guess there is enough people who I see speak up about that stuff to make it worth it."
These are the most recommended vacuum cleaners on Reddit (r/VacuumCleaners VS others) as of Jan 2025,"I’ve been doing analysis on reddit data and was looking at the most recommended vacuum cleaners in r/VacuumCleaners VS other subs. Thought I’d share the results here.

Its part of a side project of mine to play with Reddit data and LLMs. The goal was to create something useful for the community while learning and improving my development skills.

The analysis aims to highlight the most well reviewed vacuum cleaners. It can be taken as a very rough proxy for what’s widely considered the best vacuum cleaners. Hopefully it is a useful data point for anyone overwhelmed by the massive amount of fragmented information out there.

Methodology: For extraction and sentiment analysis, I used the Reddit’s API to scour discussions on vacuum cleaners across all subreddits (filtered for the past year for freshness). I sampled 586 relevant threads and used LLMs to analyze, extract, and categorize opinions from the comments. To identify the product, I used the info in the comment to lookup Amazon. Unfortunately for now the list only shows models available on Amazon (for simplicity’s sake).

For ranking, I calculated the normalized difference and ratio between the no. of positive and negative user sentiments, and used that to determine the final score for ranking.

Caveat: Handling and merging different descriptions, model numbers, abbreviations etc, and associating them with the right variation is non trivial, so its not 100% accurate. Let me know if you spot anything wrong or surprising.

Source: RedditRecs I have a Miele canister and upright, they are great and I would recommend them to anyone. I also still have a Dyson Animal upright that I bought in 2003. I think keeping them going for the long term is in doing maintenance on them. I have a Miele C1 with the cat & dog attachments and a long-coat German Shepherd. Only had the Miele for a couple years but I must've been a little high while changing bags once and forgot to put a fresh bag in. I vacuumed without a bag in it a couple times until I realized my mistake.

I spent a few hours taking the case apart which is a huge pain in the ass, and definitely not designed for end-user serviceability. There are very helpful YT videos from professionals that make it easier for sure, but I was able to get the motor out and take the covers and stuff off, then blew all the dust out with an air compressor. Luckily the filters were able to catch most of the debris and only some dust made it to the motor. After a thorough cleaning though, the thing fired right up and works and sounds like new still.

So my experience with the Miele is that despite my best efforts to destroy the thing it is an absolute tank and even if it doesn't last a ""lifetime,"" the performance and ruggedness alone make it worth every penny to me. I know this topic comes up often and it's always said that a cordless vacuum isn't BIFL. But damn if the Dyson V15 isn't life changing for me. I actually *like* vacuuming now. Lugging the cannister and cord around of my old vacuum room to room was such a chore. It's just so much easier and I like their little gimmick of showing how much dirt it's captured.

Bought mine refurbished for a nice price and had it for around 1.5 years now.

Granted I've never tried a Miele before, but I only have hardwood floors and a few spot rugs so I don't think I'd never the extra power or whatever else advantages it brings. Especially at the expense of lugging the cannister around with me."
Snap-On 50th Anniversary Tool Chest,"My latest restoration project is this Snap-on 50th Anniversary KRS-530 and KRS-558 tool chest. Manufactured in 1970 to commemorate the company’s 50th anniversary, this set featured a unique gold paint job, a stark difference from the standard red they’re known for. 2020 is now the 50th anniversary of this set.

I’ve already spent about 12 hours working on it this weekend, and I hope to have most of the work done within the upcoming week. Snap-on is sending me a complete set of new friction slides and two new locks. The casters are no longer available, so I may either purchase four new wheels or just leave the original ones on it. It’s currently completely disassembled, and  most of my time has been spent thoroughly degreasing and cleaning it. Many of the drawers had carpet glued down, so I’ve also been removing all of the adhesive. I plan on keeping the original paint and all of its hard-earned patina. I’ll be waxing and buffing it before reassembling everything.

I’ll post a follow up thread once I’ve finished.

Thanks. This is awesome. But it feels 100% out of Fallout. Is it paid for yet?"

"Ahhhh… Tonka, the prime example of buy it for life toys. Found for $12 total at the Goodwill, bound to bring me years more enjoyment.","Those were well amaze toys. Those Rescue Heroes were an action figure made much like Tonka, heavy duty I used to ride around in my tonka dump truck and push myself along with my hands even after I was much too large for it and it never broke or bent.  I have them to this day and intend on giving them to my future kids. They also make hands down the most durable dog chew toys I've ever found.

My dog, who destroys quite literally everything, treasures a thick Tonka tire chew toy she's had for years.  It's pretty fucked up at this point, but given every other toy has an average lifespan of a week or less, it's endurance is extraordinary"

and now it running like new ! 

here is the [before ](https://i.imgur.com/VjeOjGL.jpg) picture , as you can see the seat was just rusted metal...

My new Visionware - 30 years old and the cheapest way to completely avoid Teflon/Chemicals I could find,"I swear I burned water using these pans.  EVERYTHING stuck to them. I had these until i broke a couple of pieces and decided that the razor sharp splinters of glass were not worth it. Cast iron, stainless steel, carbon steel... There were other options."
Got these as a gift for my mother. Accidentally dropped the small ones loading the car from 4.5 feet. Dropped them again unloading from 3 feet. Handed same ones to my 5 year old to give to mother and the kid drops them. 0 breakages. Meets expectations even if accidentally. Strongly recommended.,"I have most of these left from the mid 90’s. 

My roommate got drunk, got into a fight with his girlfriend and threw one through the wall. It left a perfect cup shape hole. Cup was fine. The wall was not fine. 

We have dropped them onto concrete. They are still perfectly fine.

Stack a hot one on top of a cold one and they reliability explode into a million pieces. Angry pieces. Next year, everyone gets receiver gloves.

Replaced a water pump, belt and a few other minor items. I genuinely hope I can get that out of my 2007 tacoma. I just crossed 100k with no issues, so I plan to put at least 300 on it.

"Redback boots outlasted another pair of insoles. Five years of near-daily wear, harsh environments, and countless steps. Leather maintenance works wonders on quality products.","I love mine, I just wish they were resoleable. sitting here in mine right now. about 4 years on mine, last year i swapped the insoles out for some orthopedic ones. i’m not a boots person but as an automotive tech i was going through tennis shoes every couple months so i bought them and they’ve way more than paid for themselves! I have had two pairs of Red Back boots in my life, and I love them. The Chelsea style is so easy to slip on, yet they feel secure.  The soles are remarkable, and seem to last and last. Regular leather maintenance helps them look good. I've had Blundstones, but these are much more robust.  

One caution with the soles is that they are not super heat resistant. I was using a weed burner (roofing torch) on gravel. I walked on the hot gravel too soon afterwards and the gravel melted into the soles. Beware if you are using them in environments that can put hot stuff on the floor."
The signal to noise ratio in this subreddit is infuriating.,"I'm posting this after reading the rules which are poorly enforced.

Buy it for life should be about quality items that deliver utility and survive regular use through the years either through superior design and build or through the ability to regularly repair and maintain the item.

Stop posting your items that have simply survived because you kept it in a drawer or box for decades.

Stop posting your obvious items: yes great your cheese knife survived decades, is anyone surprised?

Stop posting your obsolete items.

Go post about 100 year old brass door knobs in vintage and antique forums, it's not practical or meaningful here.

Stop asking about things that are obviously not bifl like underwear, pillows and portable electronics with non user replaceable batteries.

Stop posting your items which is exactly the same as what someone else posted within a matter of hours or days, co tribute to their thread instead.

I could go on but the mod team here is not enforcing their own rules and as a result the sub reddit is not very useful. I've never seen a moderator do anything here [deleted] As much as this subreddit is a cool concept, it has an inherent problem. 

You can't know something is BIFL until you have it for a very long time. And by then it's either no longer in production or obsolete or just unobtainable. 

I realize the focus should be on quality products, but that's so hard to enforce and easy to manipulate that it's next to pointless. The framing of the sub doesn't help."
My morning ritual for the last few decades,"Why does it always taste burnt when I use mine? Decades? Well I have certainly made a fantastic investment then. Some tips for a good italian moka:
Most are made in aluminium, Bialetti makes some steel model too though.
They're all durable but you need to change the rubber gasket once in a while because it can lose elasticity with time and start to crumble.
I usually put cold tap water in the bottom container, the level of the water shouldn't go over the security valve, or at least instructions suggests so. The grind of the coffee should be the finest possible.
when you put the coffee in the filter you shouldn't press it. You can make a little ""mountain"" of coffe to make it stronger and then close the moka. The handle is cheaply made usually so try not to make too much leverage on it because it will break, also don't burn it.
Always put the stove at low-medium heat. 
DO NOT EVER WASH THE MOKA WITH SOAP. It's just coffe, just put in under the water. Be sure to remove the coffe that remains attached to the gasket and you're good to go.

sorry for my english. edit: spelling"
Allen Edmonds Shoes. Ten years old and counting...,"Beautiful. Too bad the CEO is slowly flushing the quality down the toilet by laying off the talent that made those shoes to reduce costs and maximize value.

Got this old Tupperware brand set for $20,"Hate to say it but plastic does decompose after a long time and releases particles into your food. I wouldn’t consider such old plastic safe. I drank an ocean of store brand Kool-aid out of those pitchers on the left in the early 80’s. So guys these most likely have high levels of lead. I'm too lazy to do extensive research but after some surface level internet browsing i'd say that these are in fact not BIFL if we take into consideration the possible effects they may have.

"20+ year old fjallraven jacket, freshly waxed","Girlfriend's granddad let me have it, says he doesn't remember when he got it but it's around 25 years old. Some paint stains on the sleeve but other than that, everything is perfect. I don't know if the quality went down when they started producing in China. No idea where this was made since all the tags are worn to the point of unreadable.

My 1945 Rolleiflex camera that still takes beautiful photos,"[Here’s an example photo ](https://imgur.com/gallery/bvc4Y52) (sorry for the horrible compression).

Craftsman jigsaw. My grandfather bought it in September of 1961. I inherited it and it's still going strong.,"You should pull it apart, de-grease everything and re-grease.

"Czechoslovak army boots made in 1968 - treated with kitchen oil, still waterproof and my favorite motorbike boots. (more info in comments)","Info:

These boots, known in CZ as ""kanady"" (Canadian-style boots) are ""model 60"" - introduced in the army in 1960. Black for troops, brown for officers. This pair was made in 1968, I changed the shoelaces and treated them with vegetable oil and animal fat exclusively. No polish, no wax, nothing. They are still waterproof up to the shoelace knot, I can walk through a creek with them. On the inside I use paper pad, carbon pad and on the top a plastic grid. With good socks, the shoes are very comfortable, firmly hold the ankle and have perfect grip on almost all surfaces. Even walking on ice is not a problem. 

I use them on hiking trips and on the motorbike, I had them for my trip from Brno (close to Vienna) to Scotland and back.

The best thing you can do to prolong the life os leather is never use any polish or wax on it. Use only oil, even rapeseed or sunflower oil is fine. And as many layers as possible (on the first try, I gave them 15 layers in a row).

Also, I had them on my first date with my wife. I can understand why you don't like polish on your 19**68** boots :)

The reefs they make now are using the new shitty rubber/plastic and not the heavy duty foam/rubber the old ones did.  


anyone know what the new 'top end' sandals are? My Reefs lasted years and through a lot of abuse until I eventually just wore through them. The next Reef pair I bought failed pretty quick though.

Now I'm loyal to olukai - they are super robust and have served me very well for years now. Loved my old Reefs and wore them until the top started to fray apart. The soles were really thin but SUPER cushioned. The new ones aren’t nearly as great."
"Vacuum my grandparents gave my parents, and now my parents gave me.","I got a G4 handed down from grandma recently as well.  Just finished refurbishing it.  


It'll practically suck the nails out of the floorboards. I sold these for 2 weeks, it was maybe the worst job I ever had. Their customer engagement is very scammy and shady, which is a shame because they really are incredible products. Fun fact about Kirby vacuums, they've always been sold door to door, but back in the day, the salesman would come around and collect payment for them in person monthly. Kirbys all have a slot in the handle where housewives would stick the change they found while vacuuming and that's how they'd pay the bill. 

I have the same model of Kirby, bought it used over a decade ago. The place I buy bags and belts for it at is owned by a sweet old man who relayed the above story to me. I can verify that there's a change slot, but not the rest of it."

My Coleman cooler from 1966.,"Some backstory:
My girlfriend wanted a vintage Coleman cooler and told her grandfather to be on the look out for one. What ended up happening is his father passed away (her great grandfather) and when going through his garage, found this one. A vintage Coleman is cool, but your great grandfather's? Couldn't be happier. Still works awesome!

Edit: here are a couple more pictures of the sides. http://imgur.com/gallery/CkmWLXI Be *very* careful with that around kids. There's a good reason they don't make them with latches like that anymore. Growing up I locked my little brother in one. Luckily I let him out after just a few seconds but easily could have killed him. Haunts me to this day. Shoreline and Upland? Cheers from Indiana."

JVC VN-300 amplifier from the 70s that will continue to run in our home for a few decades,"This era of audio equipment will always be my favorite. The brushed-metal-on-wood look is beautiful, and the heavy knobs and solid switches feel high quality. These old amps were built like tanks and there's a good reason they're still so popular on the used market. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, the AAFES stories (Army & Air Force Exchange Service) at most overseas bases would have dedicated stories with shelves full of these, all powered up and ready for testing.  I forgot what those stores were called... Four Seasons maybe.  Being overseas they'd also get a lot of oddball units from Kenwood, JVC, Sansui, Technics, etc that would become rare.

Unfortunately I was just a kid back then, but man those Four Seasons stereo outlets were an incredible place to be in.  I'd go in there to load up on the free brochures.  Average price of a stereo component was $300-500 back then, which is like $1500-2000 now, so that was some serious, serious money, kind of like graphics cards now. [deleted]"
I analyzed the most popular brands on r/BuyItForLife,"I'm doing some data analysis on Reddit data and as a BIFL enthusiast, I looked at the posts in this subreddit to see what brands are mentioned the most. The current timeframe is 500 days.

* how did mentions change over time? (with animation)
* what's the sentiment trend for a brand (over time)?
* what topics are people talking about for a brand?

My 1992 Numatic Henry vacuum,"[deleted] I’m an American currently in the UK for work. My shop has one of these, I used it this past week for the first time.

They need sharpening but they still cut most things fine. I have two pairs like these. Giant old heavy fabric scissors are just so cool.

My mind is stuck at 2000 I think what is more impressive is the 34 year old white plastic hasn’t turned cum stain yellow."

Eddie Bauer Has Won me as a Life Long Customer,"They're lifetime warranty is great.. I've exchanged worn equipment for new equipment, with no qestions asked free of charge, years down the road. This post isn't about that however. 

 I ordered Christmas presents for my entire family on their website in November. I knew postage was backed up but I figured it would be adequate time. As Christmas got closer, I still hadn't received the shipment. I contacted them in regards to if they were aware of any delays etc. I was expecting the typical ""Covid slowed down postage please be patient it's out of our hands now"" response. I didn't get that. I didn't get anything close. They told me the order was on its way but it was delayed. They apologized and gave me a full refund on the entire order. 

A week later I needed some waterproof hiking boots and I had a coupon for 65% off. I waited and the coupon expired. Bought the boots anyways. I chatted an employee, and they refunded me for 65% of my order even though the coupon was expired. 

I have nothing but positive things to say about this company and I thought I'd share my positive experiences here.

Edit: The worn piece of gear I talked about was a jacket that the zipper broke on one of the pockets. I asked if they were able to repair this and they replaced the entire jacket. Their flannel shirts are dope, I have 1 for each day of the week. I am a simple man haha. I’ve got a down leather jacket from them that belonged to my father. There’s photos of him wearing it holding me as a baby. I still wear it 30+ years later. This is a great story about customer service, but are the products BIFL?  Not being snarky, genuinely don’t know much about their quality."
This sippy cup they gave my wife at the hospital when she was in labor. We got like three of them before we were discharged.

My friend bought a house with this KichenAid dishwasher from 1974. He says it works better than any of the other ones he has owned. He just has to convince his wife not to replace it.,"My parents had that exact dishwasher. It lasted over 50 years without ever needing a service call or repair. I mean, yes, but the energy, noise reduction, and water savings on a new one alone should be pretty enticing. I had that dishwasher at my old house. Moved in summer 2011, and we lived with it until a remodel in 2016. I loved the new KitchenAid that replaced this one (and bought the same one for my new house), but nothing could beat the speed of the old one. 
Disagree with above; this was a noisy machine. We'd only run it before bed or heading to work because it was so loud. Couldn't watch TV with this thing running."

The ones I’ve had to deal with over the past 25 years have been crap.

5 more years before I can get antique tags!,"Bought this 2004 honda odyssey in 2021. I was ""fiscally challenged"" at that point. It's been an amazing car, just crossed 220k miles. Been recently offered $350 by carmax for it lol.

I won't lie though, it needs a bit of work all the time. Replaced:
2021: exhaust leaks 
2022: engine mounts
2023: catalytic converter (stolen), o2 sensor 
2024: needs a new rear link control arm 

It used to have an oil leak from the bolt at the bottom of the oil pan. That somehow fixed itself. Overall it's been a really good purchase and now functions as a solid second car. I often take the back seats out and use this to haul furniture or for van camping. 10/10 would recommend. As the title says, 5 more years and I can get antique plates <3 ""Honda Odyssey"" and ""antique"" should not belong in the same sentence. My mom had one for the longest time. Bought it new in 2000, got her money's worth out of it, it was totaled in 2016 or so. I miss it. We have a 2000 Honda odyssey with 58,000 miles (purchased from an elderly lady). The only issue we had was the speedometer stopped working…then fixed itself! I love this old van lol FYI: antique tags have driving stipulations.

I used to have antique tags on a daily driver and a local cop made that his business and basically targeted me until I got regular tags."

"Great grand mother moka with an interesting design, at least 60 years old.","What do you do when you don't have 3 friends? Still works flawlessly. My grand mother told me that she used to use it when she was a child, I'm being very conservative  with the 60 years old claim (my grand mother is 82 now), could easily be close to a century old, but can't really prove it now.

EDIT: tl;dr: **I'M SORRY**, turns out that this moka is around 50 years old.

Since a user requested some info on the brand I did a bit of research online (should have done it before posting maybe, sorry about that). According to the [website](https://ingeniumcaffe.it/caffettiere/nova-espress-4-tazze-irmel/) I found it was produced in 1970. I guess that all the years passed made the info on the actual age of this moka unreliable. What I can confirm now is that my father used to prepare this as a child. I feel really sorry for the bold claim of the ""century old"", this moka has been in my kitchen since I was born and I just never question any of the story behind it.

If I can make a guess, I believe that my great grand mother bought it for my grand mother's first child (as in the birth of a family, not to give coffee to an infant). I say this because everyone in the family is sure that it was a purchase made from my great grand mother.

&#x200B;

Hope you all don't feel mislead, I really never questioned the history of this moka, will bring this new knowledge to the next family dinner.

&#x200B;

BTW the maker's name is ""Nova Espress Export"" (yes, with an ""s""), the word ""Brevettata"" means patented, the material is pure aluminum, I've also found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrUiiZxPuOs) of a japanese guy using it.

EDIT2: Here are some more pictures of the moka:

EDIT 3: I've found the website for a coffee Italian museum, they have the moka on the home page actually, dating it to the 1960. I tend to trust this more than the blog I linked above, also because my grandma confirmed that she was using it before getting married and having her first child.

here's the link to the museum page with the picture of this moka:   https://www.caffepenazzi.it/2018/09/28/apre-il-museo-penazzi-della-caffettiera/


I think we can agree that this moka is between 50 and 60 years old.

As some has stated in the comments this design is now sold from Bialetti, an Italian brand of coffe maker, have a look into it if you're interested.

I'd like to thank you all for the kind words, yesterday I've talked with my granny and she was flattered that more than 2k people liked her mom's coffee maker, even if she's not really on point on what the Internet is. Have a nice day y'all! I love it and want one!"
Scored this 2 year old Herman Miller Loni desk chair for my wife with warranty still intact.,"Them things do last a life time except for the arm rests but you can buy replacement ones.

My Kenmore Refrigerator from the mid 80s. Still running strong.,"I normally would recommend keeping old appliances going, but refrigerators are tricky. 

I recently replaced a similar vintage, working refrigerator with a new ordinary Whirlpool refrigerator about two years ago. My electricity bill dropped by $25 per month for that one change alone. The new fridge pays for itself in just over three years.

The trick is to find decent quality new refrigerators, which can be hit and miss. Samsung and LG refrigerators are complete garbage. I've had good luck with Whirlpool refrigerators, although I don't care for most of their other appliances. YMMV. The fridge came with the house when we bought it in 2020. We are in the process of beginning a kitchen renovation so the fridge will be retired to the garage. Better hide OP. My wife will kill for this fridge."

They're also super easy to maintain. I keep them clean with Bar Keepers Friend and that's really all it takes to keep them nice and shiny. They're not the fanciest cookware, but for the price and how long they've held up, I can't see myself replacing them anytime soon.

Do you just mirror posts from r/productfails? I could see this really taking off. One thing I notice is that this only seems to include a time when things fails. I think this model introduces a gap for things which rarely, if ever, fail.

For example, the first thing that comes to mind for me as a BIFL item is a KitchenAid stand mixer. Despite being extremely popular, I've never heard of one failing. I'm sure it happens, but I never hear any stories.

A product like that might never end up getting reviewed on the site because it never technically meets the requirements. Or worse, there might be a one in a million failure after a month which ends up being the only review, creating the illusion that the product fails quickly.

Have you put any consideration into how to handle these types of situations?

Edit: From the replies, I feel like y'all are getting fixated on stand mixers and missing the larger point about selection bias."

Big Green Egg - it just keeps on giving,"I was given a small BGE and used it for at least 15 years, I had to replace the gaskets ( which are normal )and one internal component , which I bought since I wasn’t the original owner, gave it away probably 5 years ago when I was able to buy a large BGE, and it’s still in use today, with proper care they really will last decades. We have had ours for over 8 years now and had two bases crack and the local dealer replaced them no questions asked. It remains outside uncovered and it weathers really well.

I highly recommend you check one out. They are not cheap but the lifetime warranty is worth the price tag plus the food that you can BBQ, cook, and bake on it are just a world of difference.

There is a difference between BIFL and overly obsequious warranty service. And I suspect you are on the wrong side of it.

"Steel scissors engraved with ""Kingshead Betakut Italy."" My parents got them way before I was born 40+ years ago, and they still work brilliantly, never needed to sharpen once","[deleted] https://youtu.be/-0xcd_7vFOs

"The lid finally cracked on my wife’s sandwich box, which my mother bought in the early 1980s – half a lifetime ago.",If you can locate a Tupperware dealer they will replace the defective part for free.

There are some great stainless steel sandwich containers with silicone lids that would be a good sturdy replacement. I have had some for 12 years now and haven’t even had to replace the lid.

An actual BIFL kitchen knife for under $10. Stainless Chinese cleavers can be sharpened for decades and simply become narrower Chinese cleavers. Often sold in the US under the Winco brand or San Han NGA. This one is only 20 years old. I use it daily.,"And for folks who aren't aware, these aren't meat cleavers used to chop bones. They're lighter and used in Asian kitchens in place if French style chef knives so really a jack of all trades in the kitchen if you learn to use it.

If I had to choose between a traditional chef knife and a Chinese cleaver, it'd be the cleaver. The stone is the synthetic you'll find at nearly all Asian supermarkets and some restaurant supplies. I paid $5 but I've seen them for $3. I use the medium grit side bone dry and soak it to use the fine side. You can do wet or dry for both, but don't use oil with these, they get weird. Mind, this ain't the stone you want for your sushi knives, but for your utility beasts, it's great. I strop with an old leather belt to remove burrs. Ontario's Old Hickory brand of knives are BIFL and many are under $10. A lot of people use the 7 inch butcher knife as bushcraft knives too. It's tough 1095 steel so make sure you don't throw them in the dishwasher and dry immediately."
"Coach 9061, just given a good bath and conditioning for its 20th birthday (used heavily since 1998).","Hi, former Coach fanatic here.  I can tell you that every coach I’ve purchased within the past 10 years has absolutely  NOT held up as well as older Coach purses.  Broken zippers, discoloration, busted threads, broken buckles, torn inside lining, etc.  My older purses look brand new, but more recent purses are not worth the cost.  You’re just paying for the label at this point. Judging from the comments, seems like it’s not worth buying new anymore. How old should I look for on eBay? And does anyone have suggestions for similar style from a brand that is BIFL?  I have a backpack from about then. I wish Coach still made stuff like that."

80 years of waffles. Toastmaster 2D1.,"I know this device might have nostalgic properties but considering it having a metal body, I recommend replacing the cable with a grounded one. According to [this](http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html), the average life expectancy of the American male born 80 years ago was 62.1 years. So 80 years from a waffle iron is BIFL+.

On a side note, the life expectancy of an American woman born in 1900 was 48.3, in 1998 it was 79.5. That's crazy. My mom bought my late grandma a waffle iron for Christmas one year and she loved it. For years, my grandpa would always talk about the waffles she made she made with it, and one day she invites us over for breakfast. She cooked for us but threw the first waffle she made in the trash, and my mom asked if she got a new waffle maker. My grandma said ""no, this is the one you got me. The instructions for it say to throw the first waffle you make away."" She threw away hundreds of waffles over the years not thinking it was only the first waffle the first time you use it."

Washer made it like 20 years.  Pretty good.

Dryer made it much longer.

Had to repair the dryer once, but only because a baby rabbit had fallen down from the tube leading outside and managed to get himself killed inside the dryer, acting as a monkey wrench in the gears.  Poor little guy, I didn't mean to kill him--turned on the dryer, there was a loud thud, and it just stopped working.  Repair guy pulled him out.  Actually, that was all the repair that was needed; nothing was broken, just had a poor stupid dead rabbit clogging up the works.

But yeah, aside from unfortunate little rabbits, one other thing that isn't good for these dryers: being submerged completely by flood waters from Hurricane Sandy.

I bet the dryer would have made it another 30+ years if it hadn't been for that minor issue of being completely flooded out."

"Sears Craftsman Belt Sander. Given to me by a neighbor, said he got it when his daughter was born, she's 55",My father had a whole set of Sears power tools from this era. He’d replace the motor brushes every ten years or so. In the 1980s he gave them away and “upgraded” to new ones from Sears. They were plastic junk and he really regretted giving away the old ones. That old school Sears appliances and tools last forever! I don't know how we lost that level of build quality in American products. Does it have a ground pin on the plug?

It’s warm, quiet, and does shockingly well with precipitation management. I do believe they are a buy it for life item. IMO the Schott 740N peacoat is the almighty god of BIFL wool coats, but these are some damn good choices too."

1960's Osterizer blender - used at least once a week for the past 60 years,"We had something similar, probably from Montgomery Wards and i used to loooove playing with those buttons I have no doubt these blenders last a long time. I had a similar one that wouldn't die after 30 years. But they simply don't do as good of a job as a good modern blender.

I can't tell you why or how cause it seems pretty simple to me, spin a blade in a container, but our lowest end Vitamix does SUCH a better job. I love my Osterizer.  Mine is only around 30 years old but still going strong.  Replaced the jar/blade/lid over the years."
"My 1967 Volvo 122S. Recently met the original owner, who gave me all the service records he kept from 30 years of ownership. It has 621,000 miles.","I am the third owner of this car. My dad bought it for me when I was 13 years old as a restoration project as it had been sitting for over 20 years. Turns out, it didn't need much restoration. New carburetors and replacing the fuel lines were the only major tasks we did to get a dormant car running. It's been 10 years and I've put another 50,000 miles on it. I would drive it around town and run errands in high school and college with this. It's a great driving car. Not much power, but smooth. It just glides at 40 mph.

About 5 years ago, I was at a car show and an old man walked up to me, asking if I owned the car. Turns out he had bought my car new from a Volvo dealer on September 11, 1966 and daily drove it for 20 years. He had a commute of Wichita Falls, TX to Denton, TX (100 miles each way) 4 days a week for 2 decades. He invited me to his home and gave me a mountain of documents he kept on the car, including annual services. I didn't know the mileage until then because the odometer only went to 5 digits. But in looking at the records, I was able to confirm the mileage was (at the time) 597,000. I love this car and hope to get it to a million miles in my lifetime. That is one sexy car you have there. Grew up in a family that drove Volvo's learned to drive in a 1967 122s.  Also p1800's, with the borg warner overdrive.  Learned how to synchronize SU carbs by ear from my dad.

"May I recommend vintage, made-in-the-USA, copper-bottom, stainless-steel RevereWare—still widely and affordably available in thrift shops?","The old Revere ware pans are good. Thicker and well made. The new ones (like after 1990) are shit. Made in China, thin, warp easily, handles fall off.... Last forever, but are shit to cook with. Too thin to disperse heat evenly.  Clearly I am in the minority, but I have been cooking on the old version of Revere Ware since I was allowed near a stove in the mid 1950's.Yeah, I am old. The only burning issues I have had are with long simmering tomato sauce ( Italian Sunday gravy) and that is fixed by using the heat diffuser on the gas burner.

I have had aluminum pans and have given them away. I had some Calaphon for a while but did not like the black interior. AllClad  was meh. 

You need to make sure you  have the old ones. The mark on the bottom should say Canton Illinois. The handles and knobs on the pot tops should be bakelite not shiny plastic."
Best Coleman product I ever bought - 20+ years,"I agree. I have had a similar pair for at least 15 years.

Cut the foam arm rests off and put new foam from the plumbing department back on with glue or zip ties. My dad bought a Coleman Camping stove back in the late 70's/early 80's. 

Its still in operation. Just replaced the rubber seal on the pump. I’ve been really let down by Coleman products lately. I suspect there was a deliberate change in quality about 10 years ago. Old gear is great. Newer stuff just fails so quickly for me. Sleeping bags with broken zippers after 2 seasons. A tent whose awning tension pole splintered the first night in use. That kind of thing.

Maybe it’s just me…"

"Been using the same glove for over 30 years. Son starts his first league next week, so hopefully I'll be using this, to play catch and practice with him, for several more seasons.","Wipe that bad boy down with a damp rag then condition with some Rawlings glove butter or order you some ball players balm. It will keep that binding from cracking anymore also. It’s worth the money to buy a good baseball glove. Highly suggest upper models of Wilson, Nike, Rawlings, etc. A hidden gem company we had in St. Louis was GloveSmith too. I had bought a misprint glove from them for $80 that retailed for $300. It’s lasted me 10 years and still going strong. It’s a great feeling to support a company like them that’s made local. 

Side Note: if the glove is harder to break in, it’s probably made out of better leather. Always noticed this with the upper model gloves. They don’t feel great trying on in store, but once broke in they do. That looks great!  Did you have to add leather conditioner or anything over the years?

I have tan gloves and the surface has worn down or slightly faded over time.  The top side of your glove is still a nice black... I would've thought that a black glove would have more surface damage as leather is not naturally black but dyed."

I lived the rabbit and turtle throttle drawings. He sold it long ago but bought another one a few years back. Now he gives the grand kids tractor rides around our property. 1974 tires? good thing tractors don't go over 10MPH [deleted]
"1983 Honda Express Scooter, almost 40 years old and still runs like new.","As someone who was born in ‘83, you saying the scooter is almost 40 years old really cut me to the core. 😆 [deleted] What most people dont know is that these little scooters (among other Honda models) are how Honda motorcycles makes most of its money. They sell like hotcakes in Asia; People even race them, and theyre very serious about it."

"1981 Coleman lol Oscar, been in the family since brand new.","*lil Oscar

Damn autocorrect We have a mango colored one with cream colored lid. It's a TANK! Lasts forever! Am i the only one that didn’t know the date thing 😂"
Coleman powered cooler. Can cool to 44°f or heat to 125°f I just clean the fan from dust every so often. still have the cardboard box it came in. 21 years strong.,"Powered cooler? At this point is it just a fridge? A fridge that can…also warm some food lol Neither 44 Deg F, nor 125 deg F are appropriate cold and hot holding temps. As someone who owns one of these, they are rather unimpressive, though a neat concept. Reasons I don't like them below. 

1. You cannot leave them plugged in in a vehicle overnight and not expect a dead battery.  They also will not be cool in the morning without staying plugged in. 

2. Their cooling ability is dependent on ambient temperature.  If you want the 44°, it has to be less than 70 around it.  IIRC, you can only cool like 20° from ambient. 

For what it's purpose is, something [like this](https://www.amazon.com/SMETA-Electric-Freightliner-Cascadia-Refrigerator/dp/B06XW9JS57/) would probably work better."

The story he tells is that he started studying electrical engineering at university in the early 1970s, and his classmates were using them.

"Tivoli Audio, Henry Kloss Model One Radio. Manufactured in Feb. 2001. Purchased for $15 in thrift store about 10 years ago. Exceptional sound quality still! Have it tuned daily to WQXR classical radio, running 8-10 hours every day for years!","I feel like every radio is buy it for life. Everyone’s parents have a radio older than them The sound is great but the tuning is atrocious. The smallest bit of dust causes huge amounts of drift in the frequency reception.  Tivoli has an FAQ on ""cleaning"" the tuning pot by rotating it back and forth a number of times, which is a stop gap for a short amount of time until it happens again. From personal experience, I have to disagree on the longevity of these. I’ve got two of them that I’ve been repairing over and over again for the last 15 years. The digital circuitry inside doesn’t seem particularly reliable. I found a modification online about 10 years ago to get one of them working again, but it developed a new problem a couple years ago, and now that one just makes weird distorted sounds instead. The other one still works except on its AUX input.

I switched to the Sangean WR-16 now, which seems to be a better-built unit all around, but time will tell.

I should mention that I am a *huge* fan of Henry Kloss, the designer of this Tivoli Model One, and I own four sets of his Cambridge Soundworks Ensemble speakers, which I first bought back in 1993. Those are truly BIFL!"
"Buck 500 I bought in 1982, still works great and you can still buy it.","Upvoted as still available. I carry the same knife everyday. I was only born in 1982 though. Solid knife I carried a Buck 110 for maybe 10 years, lost it thus summer, bought another and promptly lost it.  Now I'm ""punishing"" myself by using a CRKT I had sitting around as my EDC.  If I can keep up with this CRKT until New Year's, I'm going to buy another Buck 110.  Also, I stupidly broke the tip of my 110 by doing a little prying with the tip, admitted such to Buck, and asked them if they could fix it.  They sent me a brand new 110.  Thanks for the good customer service, Buck.  Now if I could just keep up with my knives . . ."
My 30+ year old Zippo lighters....,"But it for life then have to refill it every other day.  Happy 30th. You can tell them that it all down hill from here on out.  When I smoked I always used a zippo, I didn’t play with it but I used it to light close to a pack a day and only had to fill it once every other week or so. 

If you don’t smoke and only need a lighter occasionally it’ll probably be dry when you pick it up. I also never wore out the hinge to the point of broken, that usually happens with people being cute and “flicking” it open.

As mentioned, ship it to Pennsylvania and they’ll fix it, no matter what. Absolutely BIFL for people that need a daily lighter."

I've literally not used a pencil in about 5 years :/ I can hear the sound just looking at it

Its so easy to accidentally step on it and burn your foot I have one running on my family for years too, and I find it awesome when my ma yells “grab george foreman to grill some sandwiches” because the dude fought muhammad ali, joe frazier, evander hollyfield and now his name became synonym to a grilling machine."
My 2000 Lexus es300 has been perfectly reliable and has almost all original parts after 20 years of daily driving!,"I have a 1998 ES300. Bought it in 2017 with 68k miles. Great car! I was a Lexus salesman for a while, the reliability was the strongest selling point. It wasn't usually a priority though because that market is mostly leases making it tougher to compete with more maintenance heavy hi-line brands like BMW. Lexus has a really legit certified used program if anyone is looking for one. I have a customer who brings his 2001 Lexus in for service. He has 500k miles on it."
1950s David Bradley chainsaw. Still works,"I thought it was unsafe without a chain brake. And then I saw the “throttle lock”, which I presume is lock-on and not a safety lockout mechanism. Yikes! That Chainsaw gives you and the tree an equal chance of losing a limb. All metal construction right ? Looks heavy and solid."
My Dad’s 16 year old Zippo (right) vs the one my Mom bought me earlier this year!,"I can’t reccomend the butane insert enough. One can of butane will last you forever and the lighter never leaks fuel. Worst thing about zippos is having to refill them constantly, but with butane insert it can lay in a drawer for a year and will work perfectly after. Great for infrequent users I felt like I didn't understand zippo lighters. I use them infrequently, to light insence and things,and all the fuel would evaporate between uses and I'd have to refill the whole thing everytime. Was it a dud or just something they do? My dad passed 12 years ago as of January, and about a year ago I found this Zippo in my Grandma’s shed! At least I think it was his, I can’t think of anyone else in our family who would’ve used one. I mean, he’s really the only one who smoked. 

Anyways, I was only given the new one cause I had lost the old one, but then less than a week after I got my hands on the newer Zippo, I found the old one again! So now I have two.

I personally don’t smoke, but I love fidgeting with these (also they smell amazing)

The striker on the old one is starting to wear out but it still lights as good as ever."
"8 years, 2 months, 19 days later. Thanks OluKai!",Great sandals but I have never had them last more than 3 years before the part under the foot is full of holes worn through to the foam.

How often did you wear them? 8 years daily is far different to 8 years but only a few weeks during the summer time of wear. r/BuyItForEightYears
I've had many expensive knives (all good) but my favourite is this simple $8 Opinel #7 French cheese knife which has lived in my pocket for nearly 20 years.,"There is just something about Opinel and those who choose to carry them.

The knife world is interesting.  There is a style, price point, and philosophy of use in the design and materials selected for every type of task out there. When I was 11 I went to a sort of survival camp and all of us had to bring our own pocket knife. My father gifted me with one of these. My sisters also went on that camp around the same age and got the same knive. Mine is 17 years old and I still have it. Good memories. I just moved to the the region in France where these are made and can confirm the buy it for life qualities if these knives (and the still cheap price point!) 
My partner has one that was given to him by his uncle nearly 20 years ago and with proper care and use is as sharp as ever.
He swears by not submerging it in water - a quick wipe and thorough drying does the trick!"

Around the year 2000 I think it was. I have found maybe 10 or so Trek bikes of this type in the trash over the years.    They are good enough quality to be worth maintaining and riding without being so fancy they are tricky and incompatible with things.  

I sold all of them after tuneups. that child seat looks like something from Judge Dredd. Is it a normal model in the states?"

My friends 1996 purple doc marten compared to a new black vegan one.,"I had a pair of for life docs a few years ago, heel split, called them up for the warranty. $80, and a new pair. I understand it being cheaper for them to just replace them, but I didn't know that at the time- thought they were going to repair them 🙁  I actually found a pair of docs at a thrift shop last month for $10. Some brown shoe polish and new laces and they are great! As an Al Bundy, I can safely say that ""vegan leather"" is the same polyurethane they use in $29.99 private label department store labels. It's a gimmicky word going around the industry now in place of ""pleather,"" but it's still plastic and as such will not breathe or break in."
